%<=   Less than or equal.
%   A <= B does element by element comparisons between A and B
%   and returns a matrix of the same size with elements set to logical 1
%   where the relation is true and elements set to logical 0 where it is
%   not.  A and B must have the same dimensions unless one is a
%   scalar. A scalar can be compared with any size array.
%
%   C = LE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A <= B' when A or B is an
%   object.
