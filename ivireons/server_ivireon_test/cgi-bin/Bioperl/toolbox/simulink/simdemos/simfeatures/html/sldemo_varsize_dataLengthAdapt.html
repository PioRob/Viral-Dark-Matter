%% Variable-Size Signal Length Adaptation
% This model corresponds to a hypothetical system where the length of a 
% signal changes over time by adapting to the changes of a control signal.

%% About This Demo 
% Open the demo model <matlab:open_system('sldemo_varsize_dataLengthAdapt')
% |sldemo_varsize_dataLengthAdapt|>.
%
% This model consists of two sections:  the left section generates a signal
% and converts the signal to variable size; the right section processes the 
% variable-size signal and outputs it to a scope. Length adaptation is based
% on the value of the control signal. When the control signal  falls within 
% one of the three predefined ranges, the size of the data signal changes 
% accordingly.
%
% This variable-size signal is then fed into a processing block, where 
% blocks supportive of variable-size signals, operate on it. Note the 
% application of an Embedded MATLAB(R) block with both the input and the 
% output signals of variable-size. The resulting signal, as well as the 
% signal width, are fed to a scope for visualization.
