<TITLE> GUI: System Identification Tool </TITLE>
<center><h3>System Identification Tool</h3></center>
System Identification Tool is the graphical user interface (GUI) for estimating and analyzing linear and nonlinear models in System
Identification Toolbox&#8482;. 

Using System Identification Tool, you perform the primary tasks of the identification process. You execute commands 
by making selections in the GUI menus, pop-up menus, and check boxes.<p>
System Identification Tool contains rectangular icons for each imported data set or estimated model, providing a 
visual record of your work. The data icons are on the left in the Data Board, and the model icons are on 
the right in the Model Board. You can drag and drop the data or model icons between the Data and the Model boards,
or into other open dialogs.<p>

<TITLE> The GUI Menus </Title>
<A NAME="menus">
<center><h3>System Identification Tool Menus</h3></center>
System Identification Tool has four menus in the menu bar:
     <dl>
<dt><b><A Href="idfile.htm">File</A></b> <dd>Commands for managing, saving, and exiting the 
<A Href="idimp.htm#sess">session</A>.
<dt><b><A href="idlay.htm">Options</A></b><dd>Commands for creating extra model/data boards,
 permanently deleting items in the trash, and saving layout preferences.

<TITLE> The GUI Pop-up Menus</Title>
<A NAME="popup">
<center><h3>System Identification Tool Pop-up Menus</h3></center>
System Identification Tool has four pop-up menus. By selecting from these menus, 
you issue commands for importing data or models, preparing data
for estimation (pre-processing), and creating new models and data sets. The purpose of each of the
four pop-up menus is described below:<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><A href="idimp.htm#data"><b>Import data</b></A></b><dd>Commands for importing data sets.
<dt><b><A href="idimp.htm#model"><b>Import models</b></A></b><dd>Commands for importing models.
<dt><b><A href="iddatprp.htm"><b>Preprocess</b></A></b><dd>Commands for creating new data sets based on the 
<a href="#workval">working data</a> by, for example, detrending and filtering the working data.
<dt><b><A href="idestm.htm">Estimate</A> </b><dd>Commands for creating estimation models based on the 
<a href="#workval">working data</a>.

<TITLE> The Ident Window Data and Model Boards </Title>
<A NAME="datamod">
<center><h3>The Data and Model Boards</h3></center><p>
System Identification Tool contains rectangular placeholders for data icons (8, on the left) and
 model icons (16, on the right). The 8 placeholders on the left are reserved for
data and are called the Data Board. The 16 placeholders on the right are reserved for models
and are called the Model Board. When you import or create a data set or a model, this adds a graphical
 icon to the appropriate Board. The icons can be freely moved
 around by dragging and dropping.<p>
 
You can open a window to hold additional Data or Model Boards by selecting <b>Options->Extra model/data board</b> 
in System Identification Tool.<p>
 
You select a data set or model by clicking its icon in the Data or Model Board, respectively.
Selected icons are indicated by a thick line in the icon design. To clear a selection, click a selected object.<p>  
 
To get information about how the data set or model was generated, double-click a data or model icon to 
open the Data/Model Info dialog. To get information about model parameters, click the <b>Present</b> 
button in this dialog. <p>

To delete a data set or model, drag it into the <a href="#trash">Trash</a>.<p>
 
To generate plots of selected data or model, select the appropriate check box under 
<a href="sitbgui.htm#vieww">Data Views or Model Views</a>. 
This displays the resulting plot in a new window.<p>
    
You can save the current session for future reuse, including the contents of the Model and Data Boards,
 by selecting <b>File->Save session</b> from the GUI menu. <p>

Note that data and models do not automatically produce a variable in the MATLAB workspace. 
You must export any variables in the data set or model by dragging their icons into the
 <a href="#export"><b>To Workspace</b> icon</a>.<p>

  <b>Icon Color Scheme</b> <br> 
  Three kinds of data sets are distinguished in System Identification Tool by different background colors:
 <dl>
 <dt> <li> Time domain input-output data: White background </li> 
 <dt> <li> Frequency domain input-output data: Light green background </li> 
 <dt> <li> Frequency response (FRF) data: Light brown background </li> 
 </dl>
 
  Three kinds of models (linear, nonlinear ARX and Hammerstein-Wiener) are distinguised 
  by the background colors of their icons:
 <dl>
 <dt> <li> Linear models: White background </li> 
 <dt> <li> Nonlinear ARX models: Pale blue background</li> 
 <dt> <li> Hammerstein-Wiener models: Pale pink background</li> 
 </dl>

<TITLE> Working Data vs. Validation Data </Title>
<A NAME="workval">
<center><h3>Working Data vs. Validation Data</h3></center><p>
You create new data sets and models from a data set called <b>Working
      Data</b> in the GUI. The icon for this data is shown in the center of System Identification Tool.
    To choose another working data set, drag and drop data from the Data Board into
 this location.<p>
All dialogs that use the working data will automatically reflect the new data.<p>

The data you use to validate the accuracy of your model is shown by an icon, labeled <b>Validation Data</b> under Model Views.
It is good practice to use validation data that is different from working data, from which the model was estimated. You can drag and drop any data set into this
      location to make it the validation data. To split a data set automatically into working and validation data, select <b>Preprocess->
      Quick start</b> item from the pop-up menu.<p>

The <b>Model output</b> and <b>Model resids</b> (or <i>model residuals</i>) plots, created by 
selecting the appropriate check box under Model Views, result from applying the model to a validation data set.

<TITLE> Exporting Data and Models </Title>
<A NAME="export">
<center><h3>Exporting Data and Models</h3></center><p>
Data and models do not automatically produce a variable in the MATLAB workspace. 
You must export any variables in a data set or model by dragging their icons into the
<b>To Workspace</b> icon in System Identification Tool.<p>

Models exported as IDMODEL and IDFRD objects. You can use the following commands on these 
objects: <b>bode, step, ssdata, tfdata, zpkdata, d2c</b>. 
You can also transform these objects into the LTI objects of Control System Toolbox&#8482; using the 
following commands by <b>tf, ss, zpk.</b> For more information, see the System Identification Toolbox User's Guide.<p>

Information about the model or data set is automatically exported with the variable as part of the object. 
For example, suppose that you exported the model <tt>mymodel</tt> to the workspace. You can transform this model to
continuous time by the following command:<p>
<tt>mycmodel = d2c(mymodel); % Transforming it to cont. time. <br>
 </tt><p>
If you now re-import <tt>mycmodel</tt> into System Identification Tool, it will contain the correct 
notes and diary.

<title>Deleting Models and Data Sets</title>
<a name="trash">
<center><h3>Deleting Models and Data</h3></center><p>
In System Identification Tool, you can remove data and models from the workspace by dragging them 
into the Trash icon. All associated plots are also deleted.<p>
If you want to restore any of the removed data or models to the workspace, double-click on the Trash icon in
System Identification Tool to open the Trash dialog. Then, drag and drop the icons from the Trash dialog to the data or model
placeholders in System Identification Tool.<p>
To permanently delete data in the Trash, click <b>Empty</b> in the Trash dialog. 
This is equivalent to selecting <b>Options->Empty trash</b> in System Identification Tool.
<p>
The Trash is emptied automatically when you exit the System Identification Tool by
selecting <b>File->Close</b> in System Identification Tool.<p>

When you close an additional Model and Data Board that is not empty, its contents is placed in the Trash.
