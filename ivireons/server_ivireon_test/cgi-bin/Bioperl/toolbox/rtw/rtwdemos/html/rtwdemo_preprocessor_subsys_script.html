%% Variant Subsystems Controlled by C Preprocessor Conditionals
% This demonstration illustrates Simulink(R) variant subsystems and how to use C
% preprocessor conditionals to control which child subsystem of the variant
% subsystem is active in the generated code produced by the Real-Time
% Workshop(R).

% Copyright 2009-2010 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Overview of Variant Subsystems
% A Variant Subsystem block contains two or more child subsystems where one
% child is active during model execution. The active child subsystem is referred
% to as the _active variant_. You can programmatically switch the active variant
% of the Variant Subsystem block by changing values of variables in the base
% workspace, or by manually overriding variant selection using the Variant
% Subsystem block dialog.  The _active_ _variant_ is programmatically wired to
% the Inport and Outport blocks of the Variant Subsystem by Simulink during
% model compilation.
%
% To programmatically control variant selection, A |Simulink.Variant| object is
% associated with each child subsystem in the Variant Subsystem block dialog.
% |Simulink.Variant| objects are created in the MATLAB(R) base workspace. These
% objects have a property named |Condition|, an expression, which evaluates to a
% boolean value and is used to determine the active variant child subsystem.
%
% When you generate code, you can either generate code for the active variant,
% or generate code for all of the variants of a Variant Subsystem block and
% defer the choice of active variant until it is time to compile the generated
% code.

%% Specifying Variants for a Subsystem Block
%
% Opening the demo model <matlab:open_system('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys')
% |rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys|> will run the *PostLoadFcn* defined in the
% "File: ModelProperties: Callbacks" dialog. This will populate the base
% workspace with the variables for the Variant Subsystem blocks.

open_system('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys')

%%
% The LeftController variant subsystem contains two child subsystems Linear and
% Nonlinear. The LeftController/Linear child subsystem executes when
% Simulink.Variant object LINEAR evaluates to true, and the
% LeftController/Nonlinear child subsystem executes when Simulink.Variant object
% NONLINEAR evaluates to true.
%
% Simulink.Variant's are specified for the LeftController subsystem by right-clicking
% on the LeftController subsystem and selecting |Subsystem Parameters|,
% which will open the
% <matlab:load_system('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys');open_system('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys/LeftController','parameter')
% LeftController subsystem block dialog>.
%
open_system('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys/LeftController');

%%
% The LeftController subsystem block dialog creates an association between the
% Linear and Nonlinear subsystems with two Simulink.Variant objects |LINEAR| and
% |NONLINEAR|, which exist in the base workspace.  These objects have a property
% named |Condition|, an expression, which evaluates to a boolean value and
% determines the active variant child subsystem (Linear or Nonlinear).  The
% condition is also shown in the subsystem block dialog. In this example, the
% conditions of |LINEAR| and |NONLINEAR| are 'MODE == 0' and 'MODE == 1',
% respectively.
%
% The Simulink.Variant objects of this example have been created in the
% base workspace.
LINEAR = Simulink.Variant;
LINEAR.Condition = 'MODE==0';
NONLINEAR = Simulink.Variant;
NONLINEAR.Condition = 'MODE==1';

%% Specifying a Variant Control Variable
% The variant objects permit easy reuse of arbitrarily complex conditions
% throughout a model.  Multiple Variant Subsystem blocks can use the same
% Simulink.Variant objects, permitting you to gang and toggle the activation of
% subsystem variants as a set.  You can toggle the set prior to simulation by
% changing the value of |MODE| in the MATLAB environment or when compiling the
% generated code, as explained in the next section. In this example,
% LeftController and RightController reference the same variant objects, so that
% you can toggle them simultaneously.
%
% The nonlinear controller subsystems implement hysteresis, while the linear
% controller subsystems act as simple low-pass filters. Open the
% subsystem for the left channel.  The subsystems for the right channel are similar.
%
% The generated code accesses the variant control variable |MODE|
% as a user-defined macro.  In this example, |rtwdemo_importedmacros.h| supplies
% |MODE|. Within the MATLAB environment, you specify |MODE| using a
% |Simulink.Parameter| object.  Its value will be ignored
% when generating code including preprocessor conditionals. However,
% the value is used for simulation.  The legacy header file specifies the
% value of the macro to be used when compiling the generated code, which
% ultimately activates one of the two specified variants in the embedded
% executable.

MODE = Simulink.Parameter;
MODE.Value = int32(1);
MODE.RTWInfo.StorageClass = 'Custom';
MODE.RTWInfo.CustomStorageClass = 'ImportedDefine';
MODE.RTWInfo.CustomAttributes.HeaderFile = 'rtwdemo_importedmacros.h';

%% Simulating the Model with Different Variants
% Because you set the value of |MODE| to 1, the model uses the
% nonlinear controllers during simulation.
sim('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys')
youtnl = yout;

%%
% If you change the value of |MODE| to 0, the model uses the
% linear controllers during simulation.
MODE.Value = int32(0);
sim('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys')
youtl = yout;

%%
% You can plot and compare the response of the linear and nonlinear
% controllers:
figure('Tag','CloseMe');
plot(tout, youtnl.signals(1).values, 'r-', tout, youtl.signals(1).values, 'b-')

%% Using C Preprocessor Conditionals
% This demo model has been configured to generate C preprocessor conditionals.
% Selecting <matlab:rtwbuild('rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys') Build Model from
% the Tools/Real-Time Workshop menu item> will generate code for the model.
%
% Code generation of preprocessor conditionals is active when
%
% # *Inline Parameters* is selected on the Optimization pane of the
% Configuration Parameters dialog box.
% # Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder target is selected on the
% Real-Time Workshop pane of the Configuration Parameters dialog box.
% # The *Override variant conditions and use following variant* is _not_ selected
% on the Variant Subsystem block parameter dialog box.
%
% and
%
% # *Generate preprocessor conditionals* in the Real-Time Workshop/Interface
% pane of the Configuration Parameters dialog is set to
% |Use local settings| and you have selected *Generate preprocessor conditionals*
% on the Variant Subsystem block parameter dialog box, or
% # *Generate preprocessor conditionals* in the Real-Time Workshop/Interface
% pane of the Configuration Parameters dialog is set to
% |Enable all|. In this case, preprocessor conditionals will be generated
% for all Variant Subsystem blocks that have _not_ selected the *Override variant
% conditions and use following variant* Variant Subsystem parameter dialog box.
%
% The Real-Time Workshop code generation report contains sections in the Code
% Variants report dedicated to the subsystems that have variants controlled by 
% preprocessor conditionals.
%
% In this demo, the generated code includes references to the Simulink.Variant objects
% |LINEAR| and |NONLINEAR|, as well as the definitions of macros corresponding
% to those variants.  Those definitions depend on the value of |MODE|, which is
% supplied in an external header file |rtwdemo_importedmacros.h|.  The active
% variant is determined by using preprocessor conditionals (#if) on the
% macros (#define) |LINEAR| and |NONLINEAR|.
%
% The macros |LINEAR| and |NONLINEAR| are defined in the generated
% |rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys_types.h|, header file:
%
%    #ifndef LINEAR
%    #define LINEAR      (MODE == 0)
%    #endif
%
%    #ifndef NONLINEAR
%    #define NONLINEAR   (MODE == 1)
%    #endif
%
% In the generated code, the code related to the variants is guarded by C
% preprocessor conditionals. For example, in |rtwdemo_preprocessor_subsys.c|,
% the calls to the step and initialization functions of each variant are
% conditionally compiled:
%
%    /* Outputs for atomic SubSystem: '<Root>/LeftController' */
%    #if LINEAR
%        /* Output and update for atomic system: '<S1>/Linear' */
%    #elif NONLINEAR
%        /* Output and update for atomic system: '<S1>/Nonlinear' */
%    #endif
%
