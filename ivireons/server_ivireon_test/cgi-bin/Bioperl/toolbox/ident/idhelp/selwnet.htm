<title>Help: Wavelet Network Number of Units Selection</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Selecting Number of Units for a Wavelet Network</h3></center>

A Wavelet Network nonlinearity estimator is represented by the WAVENET object.
The most commonly set property of this network is its number of units, represented 
by the "NumberOfUnits" property. For more information on WAVENET, type "idprops wavenet", 
or "help wavenet".

<p>
The "NumberOfUnits" property can be set to be determined interactively during estimation. 
When set this way, a bar graph showing the model fit as a function of number of units is 
presented to the user. In this figure, each bar represents the percentage of unexplained 
variance as a function of number of units. Each bar can be clicked to select the corresponding 
number of units for estimation use. A bar is also preselected based on generalized cross-validation 
criterion (GCV). The preselected bar is colored blue while the other bars are colored yellow 
(on figures with light-colored backgrounds).
</p>

<p> 
Click on a bar in the figure. The selected bar changes its edge color to red. 
The corresponding number of units is shown in the "# of units" text box. 
The corresponding fit to estimation data is shown beneath this edit box. 
Click on "OK" button to use the selected value. 
</p>

<p>
<b>How to choose:</b> The fit to the estimation data increases as number of units is 
increased. Choose the smallest possible value that provides a reasonable fit to 
the data. The idea is to keep the model complexity as low as possible without sacrificing 
the flexibility required to capture the underlying dynamics. Having too high a value for number 
of units can introduce too many parameters in the model and thereby making the model estimation 
more sensitive to noise.
