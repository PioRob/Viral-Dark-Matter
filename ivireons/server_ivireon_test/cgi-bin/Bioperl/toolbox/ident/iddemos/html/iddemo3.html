%% Introduction
% Choosing a model structure is usually the first step towards its
% estimation. There are various possibilities for structure - state-space
% and polynomial forms such as ARX, ARMAX, OE, BJ etc. If you do not have
% detailed prior knowledge of your system, such as its noise
% characteristics and indication of feedback, the choice of a reasonable
% structure may not be obvious. Also for a given choice of structure, the
% order of the model needs to be specified before the corresponding
% parameters are estimated. System Identification Toolbox(TM) offers some
% tools and utilities to assist in the task of model order selection. 
%
% The choice of a model order is also influenced by the amount of delay.
% A good idea of the input delay simplifies the task of figuring out the
% orders of other model coefficients. Discussed below are some options for
% input delay determination and model structure and order selection. 

%% Choosing and Preparing Example Data for Analysis
% The example described here uses the hair dryer data, also used by iddemo1
% ("Estimating Simple Models from Real Laboratory Process Data"). 
% The process consists of air being fanned through a tube. The air is
% heated at the inlet of the tube, and the input is the voltage applied to
% the heater. The output is the temperature at the outlet of the tube.
%%
% Let us begin by loading the measurement data and doing some basic
% preprocessing: 
load dry2

%%
% Form a data set for estimation of the first half, and a reference set for
% validation purposes of the second half: 
ze = dry2(1:500); 
zr = dry2(501:1000); 

%%
% Detrend each of the sets:
ze = detrend(ze); 
zr = detrend(zr);

%%
% Let us look at a portion of the estimation data:
plot(ze(200:350))

%% Estimating Input Delay
% There are various options available for determining the time delay from
% input to output. These are:
%%
%
% * Using the |DELAYEST| utility.
% * Using a non-parametric estimate of the impulse response, using |IMPULSE|. 
% * Using the state-space model estimator |N4SID| with a number of
%   different orders and finding the delay of the 'best' one.
%

%%
% *Using |delayest|*:
%
% Let us discuss the above options in detail. Function |delayest| returns
% an estimate of the delay for a given choice of orders of numerator and
% denominator polynomials. This function evaluates an ARX structure:
%
% |y(t) + a1*y(t-1) + ... + ana*y(t-na) = b1*u(t-nk) + ...+bnb*u(t-nb-nk+1)|
%
% with various delays and chooses the delay value that seems to return the best
% fit. In this process, chosen values of |na| and |nb| are used.
delay = delayest(ze) % na = nb = 2 is used, by default

%%
% A value of 3 is returned by default. But this value may change a bit if
% the assumed orders of numerator and denominator polynomials (2 here) is
% changed. For example:
delay = delayest(ze,5,4) 

%%
% returns a value of 2. To gain insight into how |delayest| works, let us
% evaluate the loss function for various choices of delays explicitly. We
% select a second order model (|na=nb=2|), which is the default for
% |delayest|, and try out every time delay between 1 and 10. The loss
% function for the different models are computed using the validation data
% set:
V = arxstruc(ze,zr,struc(2,2,1:10));

%%
% We now select that delay that gives the best fit for the
% validation data:

[nn,Vm] = selstruc(V,0); % nn is given as [na nb nk]
%%
% The chosen structure was:
nn
%%
% which show the best model has a delay of nn(3) = 3.
%%
% We can also check how the fit depends on the delay. This information is
% returned in the second output |Vm|. The logarithms of a quadratic loss
% function are given as the first row, while the indexes |na|, |nb| and
% |nk| are given as a column below the corresponding loss function. 

Vm
%%
%
%  The choice of 3 delays is thus rather clear, since the corresponding
%  loss is minimum.  

%%
% *Using |impulse|*
%
% To gain a better insight into the dynamics, let us compute the impulse
% response of the system. We will use the function |impulse| to compute
% a non-parametric impulse response. We plot this response with a
% confidence interval represented by 3 standard deviations.
impulse(ze,'sd',3,'fill')
%%
% The filled light-blue region shows the confidence interval for the
% insignificant response in this estimation. There is a clear indication
% that the impulse response "takes off" (leaves the uncertainty region)
% after 3 samples. This points to a delay of three intervals.

%%
% *Using |n4sid| based state-space evaluation* 
% We may also estimate a family of parametric models to find the delay
% corresponding to the "best" model. In case of state-space models, a range
% of orders may be evaluated simultaneously and user gets prompted to choose
% the best order. Execute the following command to invoke |n4sid| in an
% interactive mode: 
% |m = n4sid(ze,1:15);| % All orders between 1 and 15. 
%
% <<../Figures/iddemo3_modelorder_ss.png>>
%%
% The plot indicates an order of 4 as the best value. For this choice, let
% us compute the impulse response of the model |m|:
m = n4sid(ze,4);
impulse(m,'sd',3,'fill')

%%
% As with non-parametric impulse response, there is a clear indication that
% the delay from input to output is of three samples. 

%% Choosing a Reasonable Model Structure
% In lack of any prior knowledge, it is advisable to try out various
% available choices and use the one that seems to work the best.
% State-space models may be a good starting point since only the number of
% states needs to be specified in order to estimate a model. Also, a range 
% of orders may be evaluated quickly, using |n4sid|, for determining the
% best order, as described in the next section. For polynomial models, a
% similar advantage is realized using the |arx| estimator. Output-error
% (OE) models may also be good choice for a starting polynomial model
% because of their simplicity.  

%% Determining Model Order
% Once you have decided upon a model structure to use, the next task is to
% determine the order(s). In general, the aim should be to not use a model
% order higher than necessary. This can be determined by analyzing the
% improvement in %fit as a function of model order. When doing this, it is
% advisable to use a separate, independent dataset for validation.
% Choosing an independent validation data set (|zr| in our example) would
% improve the detection of over-fitting. 
%
% In addition to a progressive analysis of multiple model orders, explicit
% determination of optimum orders can be performed for some model
% structures. Functions |arxstruc| and |selstruc| may be used for choosing
% the best order for ARX models. For our example, let us check the fit for
% all 100 combinations of up to 10 |b|-parameters and up to 10
% |a|-parameters, all with a delay value of 3:
V = arxstruc(ze,zr,struc(1:10,1:10,3));

%%
% The best fit for the validation data set is obtained for:
nn = selstruc(V,0)

%%
% Let us check how much the fit is improved for the higher order models.
% For this, we use the function |selstruc| with only one input. In this
% case, a plot showing the fit as a function of the number of
% parameters used is generated. The user is also prompted to enter the
% number of parameters. The routine then selects a structure with these
% many parameters that gives the best fit. Note that several different
% model structures use the same number of parameters. Execute the following
% command to choose a model order interactively:
%
% |nns = selstruc(V)| %invoke selstruc in an interactive mode 
%
% <<../Figures/iddemo3_modelorder_arx.png>>

%%
% The best fit is thus obtained for nn = [4 4 3], while we see that the
% improved fit compared to nn = [2 2 3] is rather marginal. 
%
% We may also approach this problem from the direction of reducing a higher
% order model. If the order is higher than necessary, then the extra
% parameters are basically used to "model" the measurement noise. These
% "extra" poles are estimated with a lower level of accuracy (large
% confidence interval). If their are cancelled by a zero located nearby,
% then it is an indication that this pole-zero pair may not be required to
% capture the essential dynamics of the system. 
%
% For our example, let us compute a 4th order model:
th4 = arx(ze,[4 4 3]);

%%
% Let us check the pole-zero configuration for this model. We can also
% include confidence regions for the poles and zeros corresponding to 3
% standard deviations, in order to determine how accurately they are
% estimated and also how close the poles and zeros are to each other.
zpplot(th4,3)

%%
% The confidence intervals for the two complex-conjugate poles and zeros
% overlap, indicating they are likely to cancel each other. Hence, a second
% order model might be adequate. Based on this evidence, let us compute a
% 2nd order ARX model: 
th2 = arx(ze,[2 2 3]);
%%
% We can test how well this model (|th2|) is capable of reproducing the
% validation data set. To compare the simulated output from the two models
% with the actual output (plotting the mid 200 data points) we use the
% |compare| utility:
compare(zr(150:350),th2,th4)

%% 
% The plot indicates that there was no significant loss of accuracy in
% reducing the order from 4 to 2. We can also check the residuals
% ("leftovers") of this model, i.e., what is left unexplained by the model.
e = resid(ze,th2);
plot(e(:,1,[])), title('The residuals')

%%
% We see that the residuals are quite small compared to the signal level of
% the output, that they are reasonably well (although not perfectly)
% uncorrelated with the input and among themselves. We can thus be
% (provisionally) satisfied with the model |th2|. 

%% 
% Let us now check if we can determine the model order for a state-space
% structure. As before, we know the delay is 3 samples. We can try all
% orders from 1 to 15 with a fixed delay of 3 in |n4sid|. Execute the
% following command to try various orders and choose one interactively.
%
% |ms = n4sid(ze,[1:15],'nk',3);| %n4sid estimation with variable orders
%
% <<../Figures/iddemo3_modelorder_ss2.png>>
%%
% The default order, indicated in the figure above, is 3, that is in good
% agreement with our earlier findings. Finally, we compare how the
% state-space model |ms| and the ARX model |th2| compare in reproducing the
% measured output of the validation data: 
ms = n4sid(ze,3,'nk',3);
compare(zr,ms,th2)

%%
% The comparison plot indicates that the two models are practically
% identical. 

%% Conclusions
% This demo described some options for how to go about choosing a
% reasonable model order. Determining delay in advance can simplify the
% task of choosing orders. With ARX and state-space structures, we have
% some special tools (|arx| and |n4sid| estimators) for automatically
% evaluating a whole set of model orders, and choosing the best one among
% them. The information revealed by this exercise (using utilities such as
% |arxstruc|, |selstruc|, |n4sid| and |delayest|) could be used as a
% starting point when estimating models of other structures, such as BJ and
% ARMAX.
