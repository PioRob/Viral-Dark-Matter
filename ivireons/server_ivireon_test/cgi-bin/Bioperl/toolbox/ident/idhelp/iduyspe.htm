<title>Data Spectra</title><p>

The Data Spectra plot is opened by selecting the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The plot shows the spectra of the output and input signals for selected data sets. <p>

You set the method for computing/estimating the spectra by selecting either <b>Periodogram</b>
or <b>Spectral analysis</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.<p>

<b>Spectral analysis</b>
 The method and resolution parameters are set in the Spectral Model dialog, which you open
 by selecting <b>Estimate->Spectral model</b> from the pop-up meu in the ident window. 
     Only scalar resolution parameters are accepted for the SPAFDR
    case. You set the frequency range in the Set Frequency Range dialog, opened by selecting
    <b>Options->Frequency range</b> in the plot window.<p>
The periodogram is the absolute square of the Fourier transform of the data
 sequence.
