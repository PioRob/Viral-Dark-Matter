%% Enabled Subsystems
% 
% This demonstration shows what happens when a sign wave is fed into an 
% enabled subsystem.  After running the simulation, the scope shows three
% plots.  
% 
% The first of these plots shows the original sine wave and the absolute 
% value of the original sine wave offset by two.  The absolute value of the sine
% wave is only shown when the subsystem is enabled.  This occurs between
% 0 and 2.5 seconds and 5 and 7.5 seconds.  When the subsystem is not
% enabled then the output of the subsystem is reset to 0.  The value of 0 is
% determined by the initial condition of the outport. You can see when 
% the subsystem is enabled by looking at the second plot.  A value of 1 
% indicates that it is enabled.
% 
% The second plot shows the original value of the enable signal.  If the signal
% is towards the top of the plot then the subsystem related to the first plot
% is enabled.  If the signal is towards the bottom of the plot then the
% subsystem related to the third plot is enabled.  The difference on when the
% subsystems are enabled is caused by the logical NOT block.
% 
% The third plot shows the original sine wave and the saturation limited sine 
% wave offset by two.  The saturated value of the sine wave is only shown when 
% the subsystem is enabled.  This occurs between 2.5 and 5 seconds and 7.5
% and 10 seconds.
