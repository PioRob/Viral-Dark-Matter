<title>Help: Network Import Dialog</title>
<body>

<center><h3>Network Import Dialog</h3></center>

<p>This dialog facilitates import of neural network objects
from MATLAB workspace or from a MAT file. Choose the corresponding radio button 
to select either the Workspace or a MAT file as the source to import the network 
object from. For a MAT file, you may either specify the name of the file explicitly
(with qualified path, if file is not located in the present working directory or 
exists on MATLAB path), or you can browse for it by clicking on the Browse button.</p>

<p> The network object must be created using functions
available in the Neural Network Toolbox&#8482; (such as feedforwardnet, cascadeforwardnet, 
linearlayer). The input dimensions of the network object must either be unset (size=0; default)
or match the number of active model regressors. Refer to the documentation on network object 
of Neural Network Toolbox for more information. Also, see help on "neuralnet", which is the
nonlinearity estimator that makes use of the network object in Nonlinear ARX
models.</p>
