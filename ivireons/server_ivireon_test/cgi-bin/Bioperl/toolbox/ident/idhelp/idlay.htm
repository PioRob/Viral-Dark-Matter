<title> Layout and Preferences </title><p>
The graphical user interface is governed by a number of settings, including colors, 
window sizes, axes sizes, and default selections. <p>

During a session, you often move and resize windows. When windows are closed and
then opened again, they keep their previous sizes and positions on the screen.
When you, however, close a window by using the window manager,
it has its default size and position when opened again. <p>

To save the current window layout and check-box status, select <b>Options->Save preferences</b> in the ident window.
To restore default settings, select <b>Options->Default preferences</b>.<p>

The layout preferences are stored in <tt>idprefs.mat</tt>, which is located in the
same directory as your <tt>startup.m</tt> file (by default). To set a different directory for this file,
issue the <tt>midprefs</tt> command in the MATLAB command window.<p>

The options in the plot windows - including the default color 
order of the object icons and plot curves - are defined in the
file <tt>idlayout.m</tt>. To customize these defaults, edit a copy of this
file and place it in a directory in your <tt>matlabpath</tt>, before the
regular <tt>ident</tt> directory.
