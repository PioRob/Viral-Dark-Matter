<center><h2>Nonlinear ARX Model Configuration</h2></center>

<p>Nonlinear ARX model represents a parallel form of
nonlinearity where simple transformation of measured inputs and outputs (called
"regressors") are used in parallel linear and nonlinear blocks to describe the
observed phenomenon. Configuration of these models involves two steps – setting
the model regressors and configuring the properties of the nonlinearity. The
two tabbed panels titled "Regressors" and "Model Properties" facilitate these
two steps. For multi-output systems, these specifications have to be done
separately for each output. In multi-output cases, select the output for
configuration from the outputs popup (this popup is hidden if working data has
only one output). The check box "apply settings to all outputs" allows
specifications for regressors and model properties to be applied to all
outputs.</p><hr>

<center><h3>Regressors</h3></center>

<p>The regressors are specified by entering the delay and
number of terms in the table under the Regressors panel. Each row in the table
corresponds to a single input or output channel. The first column lists the
names of input/output channels. For each channel, specify the delay and
number of terms in the second and the third columns respectively. The fourth
column is a visual aid for the list of regressors that will be created for each
channel. See the <a href="#regressor_table_note">explanation</a> on these
entries below. </p>

<p>Press Infer Input Delay... button to determine delay from
each input to each output graphically.</p>

<p>Press Edit Regressor... button to view a list of all
regressors, select a subset for nonlinear block and create new (custom) regressors.</p>

<p><b><a href="iddelayest.htm">Inferring Input Delay by
Inspection of Working Data</a></b></p>

<p><b>More Options for Working with Regressors</b>: The
specification of integers for delay and number of terms creates a default set
of regressors called "standard regressors". These are simple delayed version of
measured data signals, such as y(t-1), y(t-2),..., u(t-1), u(t-2),.. etc. By
default, all of these regressors are used as inputs to both the linear and the
nonlinear blocks. The choice of the regressors to use may further be customized
by exercising the following options:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Creating arbitrary functions of input and output variables
     (such as y(t-1)^2*u(t-5)) and using them as regressors. These are called
     "custom regressors".</li>
 <li>Using only a subset of regressors in the nonlinear block.
     Note that all regressors (standard + custom) are always used in the linear
     block. The choice of selection of a subset of regressors is only for the
     nonlinear block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Press the Edit Regressors... button to exercise these
options. Follow the links below for more information:</p>

<center><h3>Model Properties</h3></center>

<p>Model properties panel is selected by clicking on the corresponding
tab. This panel offers choices regarding the configuration of the nonlinearity
estimator.</p>

<p><b>Nonlinearity estimator</b>: From the Nonlinearity popup,
select a type of nonlinearity to use in the nonlinear block of the model.
Available choices are: Wavelet Network (default), Tree Partition, Sigmoid Network, Neural
Network, Custom Network and None. Properties related to the selected
nonlinearity are configured in the group box located beneath the popup. </p>

<p><b>Linear Block</b>: You may also include or exclude the
linear block from the Nonlinear ARX model by using the corresponding checkbox,
located adjacent to the nonlinearity popup. This choice is available only
if the selected nonlinearity is one of Wavelet Network, Sigmoid Network or
Custom Network. There are no configurable properties of the linear block. The
only choice available, as indicated above, is whether to include it in the
model or not.</p>

<p><b><a href="nlarx_nonlin.htm">Nonlinearity Configuration</a></b>:
When a nonlinearity type is selected in the popup, the group box beneath it
updates to show the properties of the chosen nonlinearity. For most
nonlinearities, the main choice is the number of units to use. Reasonable
default settings are available for all properties. For more information on
nonlinearity configuration, click <a href="nlarx_nonlin.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p><a name="regressor_table_note"><b>A note on entries in the
regressor table:</b></a></p>

<p>For Nonlinear ARX models, the outputs are coupled – the
prediction of a particular output can make use of past samples of its own
values, values of all inputs as well as past samples of all <i>other</i>
outputs. For example, if working data has two outputs y1 and y2, and one
input u1, then:</p>

<pre>predicted value of y1(t) = f( y1(t-1), y1(t-2), y1(t-3),... y1(t-na1),
                              y2(t-1), y2(t-2), y1(t-3),... y2(t-na2),
                              u1(t-nk), u1(t-nk-1), u1(t-nk-2),... u1(t-nk-nb+1)
                            )
</pre>

<p>In the above expression, "nk" refers to the input delay. The
output delay is fixed to 1. There are na1 terms from y1, na2 terms from y2 and
nb terms from u1. The integers entered in the regressors table have the same
meaning as in the linear ARX model case. Number of terms for input channels
corresponds to the coefficient "nb" while the number of terms for output
channels is "na". Delay on input channels is same as coefficient "nk". </p>
