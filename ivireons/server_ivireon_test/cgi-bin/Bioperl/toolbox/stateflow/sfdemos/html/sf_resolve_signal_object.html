%% Resolve Signal Object
% 
% This demonstration shows how Stateflow(R) local variables and outputs can be resolved to Simulink(R) Signal Objects.
% Double click on the chart 'Signal Object Chart'. Open Model Explorer and navigate to the chart object. Notice, in the 
% properties pane for the variables y1, y2 and local, the resolve to Simulink signal object checkbox is set. The Simulink 
% signal objects corresponding to these variables have been setup to load automatically with the model. Look at the 
% MATLAB(R) base workspace to view these signal objects which have the same name as the chart variables.
% 
% Run the simulation and notice the types on the output signals. Also note the output values in the scope and the display. 
% Now change some of the attributes of the signal objects associated with these variables from the MATLAB prompt. Run 
% the simulation again. Notice the types and values have changed to reflect the properties set on the Simulink signal object.
