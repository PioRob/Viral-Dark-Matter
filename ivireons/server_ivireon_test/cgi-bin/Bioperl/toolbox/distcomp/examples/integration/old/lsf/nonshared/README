This directory contains files that allow DCT to be used with 
LSF in the absence of a shared file system between the client 
and the cluster machines.


The examples cover the following scenarios:

1. UNIX client submitting jobs to a UNIX cluster
------------------------------------------------
Use the files in the subdirectory "unix"
