%FALSE  False array.
%   FALSE is short-hand for logical(0).
%   FALSE(N) is an N-by-N matrix of logical zeros. 
%   FALSE(M,N) or FALSE([M,N]) is an M-by-N matrix of logical zeros.
%   FALSE(M,N,P,...) or FALSE([M N P ...]) is an M-by-N-by-P-by-...
%   array of logical zeros.
%   FALSE(SIZE(A)) is the same size as A and all logical zeros.
%
%   FALSE(N) is much faster and more memory efficient than LOGICAL(ZEROS(N)).
%
%   Note: The size inputs M, N, and P... should be nonnegative integers. 
%   Negative integers are treated as 0.
%
%   See also TRUE, LOGICAL.
