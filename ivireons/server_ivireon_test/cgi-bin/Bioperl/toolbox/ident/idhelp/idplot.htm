<title>Help: Time Plot</title>
The Time Plot is opened by selecting the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The time plot shows one or more data sets you selected. For multi-input/multi-output data 
sets, you select the input-output pair in the <b>Channel</b> menu.<p>

The output is the upper plot, and the input is the lower plot. The input
is plotted so that it is piecewise constant between the sampling instants.
To change this to linear interpolation, select <b>Style->Regular input</b>
in the time plot window. <P>

The time scales are consistent with the information about sampling time
and start time entered when importing the data.
