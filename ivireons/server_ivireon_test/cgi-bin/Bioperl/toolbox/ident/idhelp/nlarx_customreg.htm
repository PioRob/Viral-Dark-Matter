<title>Help: Creating Custom Regressors</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Creating Custom Regressors</h3></center>

<p>The Custom Regressors dialog facilitates creation of new
regressors for the output currently selected in the Nonlinear Models window.
This dialog is launched by pressing the Create... button in the Model
Regressors dialog. Note that the Model Regressors dialog is launched by
pressing the Edit Regressor... button in the Nonlinear Models window's
Regressors (tabbed) panel.</p>

<p>In the Custom Regressors dialogs, custom regressors may be
created in two ways:
<ol>
<li>Enter regressor expression (first radio button):  Create one regressor at a time by specifying
    its expression by hand. </li>
<li>Generate a set of polynomial regressors (second radio button) – Create a set of polynomial type
    regressors by specifying the maximum power of any term and whether to use
cross-terms or not. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Press the Add button to add the regressor(s) created in
either of the two ways. Press Close button to close this dialog.</p>

<p><b>Creating a regressor by specifying its expression</b>:<br>
Type the formula as a function of model input and output
variables in the edit box labeled "Expression". When the Custom Regressors dialog
is first launched, an example formula is pasted into this edit box. Clicking on
a row in the table beneath the Expression edit box causes the corresponding
variable to be pasted into the edit box. In the pasted expression, there is a
"?" symbol in place of the delay integer, which must be replaced by a valid
delay value.</p>

<p>After typing the expression in the edit box, press the Add
button to add the typed expression as a new custom regressor to the Nonlinear
ARX model's current output.</p>

<p><b>Creating polynomial type regressors</b>:<br>
Polynomial type regressors are simple products of I/O
variables such as y1(t-1)^2, u1(t-2)^2, u1(t-1)^3, y1(t-1)*u1(t-2) etc. They
are created by specifying the maximum power of a polynomial term (default 2)
and choosing to include or exclude (default) the cross terms. Maximum power
allowed is 4, that is, all regressors will have a power of 4 or less.</p>

<p>All possible products of standard regressors of order less
than or equal to the maximum power are used to generate a list of custom
regressors. If the check box for including cross-terms is not checked,
combinations including more than one variable are excluded from the list. The
list of regressors that will be created as a result of a particular choice of
maximum power and inclusion (or exclusion) of cross-terms is listed in the
table titled Resulting Regressors. After maximum power value or check-box
status is changed, press on the Refresh button to refresh the contents of the
table (the contents of the table do not refresh automatically). </p>

<p>Press the Add button to add the set of polynomial type
regressors to the model. </p>
