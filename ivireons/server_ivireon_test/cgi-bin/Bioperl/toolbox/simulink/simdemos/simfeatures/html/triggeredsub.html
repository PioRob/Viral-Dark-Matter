%% Triggered Subsystems
% 
% This demonstration shows the concept of triggered subsystems and what the 
% different trigger types are.  A triggered subsystem is executed for one time step
% only each time the trigger port transitions from false to true in a certain direction.
% The transition of the trigger port may occur when the direction of the transition
% is rising, falling or both rising and falling.
% 
% A rising transition occurs when the trigger signal transitions from zero or below
% to a positive value.  A falling transition occurs when the trigger signal transitions
% from zero or above to a negative value.
% 
% After running the simulation, look closely at the top plot in the scope.  This shows
% a sine wave, a waveform and the grounded value of zero.  As the waveform
% transitions through zero, each of the subsystems is triggered appropriately.  The
% output of each subsystem is equal to the current value of the sine wave at the time.
% 
% To help view exactly what is going on, you may want to turn the scope cross-hair on.
% You can do this by double clicking on the block that says Scope Crosshair.  This will
% enable a set of cross-hairs on the scope so that s you move your mouse you can line
% corresponding values up across the plots.
