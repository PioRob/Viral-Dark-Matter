%% Portal Crane with Predefined Trajectory
%
% The vrcrane_traj example is based on the vrcrane_joystick demonstration example, 
% instead of interactive operator control it has a predefined load trajectory.
% 
% In addition to the vrcrane_joystick example, this model shows a technique 
% to create visual impression of joining/splitting the moving objects in the VRML world. 
% Crane magnet attaches the load box, moves it to a different location and 
% then releases the box and returns to the initial position. 
% This effect is achieved using an additional, geometrically identical shadow object 
% that is placed as an independent object outside of the crane objects hierarchy. 
% At any time, only one of the Load / Shadow object is displayed, using two 
% VRML Switch nodes connected by the ROUTE statement. 
% After the crane moves the load to a new position, at the time of the load release, 
% a VRMLScript assigns the new shadow object position according to the current 
% Load position. Shadow object becomes visible, and as it is independent from the rest 
% of the crane moving parts hierarchy, it stays at its position as the crane moves away.

% For details on how the crane model hierarchy and scripting logic is implemented 
% please view the associated commented VRML file portal_crane.wrl in a text editor.
