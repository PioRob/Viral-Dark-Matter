%% Temperature Control in a Heat Exchanger
% This demo shows how to design  feedback and feedforward 
% compensators to regulate the temperature of a chemical 
% reactor through a heat exchanger.

%% Heat Exchanger Process
% A chemical reactor called "stirring tank" is depicted below. The top inlet
% delivers liquid to be mixed in the tank. The tank liquid must be 
% maintained at a constant temperature by varying the amount of
% steam supplied to the heat exchanger (bottom pipe) via its control valve. 
% Variations in the temperature of the inlet flow are the main source
% of disturbances in this process.
%
% <<../Figures/heatex_01.png>>

%%
% *Figure 1*: Stirring Reactor with Heat Exchanger.

%% Using Measured Data to Model The Heat Exchanger Dynamics
%
% To derive a first-order-plus-deadtime model of the heat exchanger
% characteristics, inject a step disturbance in valve voltage |V| and record
% the effect on the tank temperature |T| over time. The measured response in
% normalized units is shown below:
heatex_plotdata
title('Measured response to step change in steam valve voltage');

%%
% The values t1 and t2 are the times where the response attains 28.3% and
% 63.2% of its final value. You can use these values to estimate the time 
% constant |tau| and dead time |theta| for the heat exchanger:
t1 = 21.8; t2 = 36.0;
tau = 3/2 * ( t2 - t1 )
theta = t2 - tau

%%
% Verify these calculations by comparing the first-order-plus-deadtime
% response with the measured response:
s = tf('s');
Gp = exp(-theta*s)/(1+tau*s)

%%
hold on, step(Gp), hold off
title('Experimental vs. simulated response to step change');

%%
% The model response and the experimental data are in good agreement.
% A similar bump test experiment could be conducted to estimate the
% first-order response to a step disturbance in inflow temperature.
% Equipped with models for the heat exchanger and inflow disturbance, we
% are ready to design the control algorithm.

%% Feedback Control
% A block diagram representation of the open-loop process is shown below.
%
% <<../Figures/heatex_02.png>>

%%
% *Figure 2*: Open-Loop Process.

%%
% The transfer function 
%
% $$ G_p(s) = {e^{-14.7 s} \over 21.3s+1} $$
%
% models how a change in the voltage |V| driving the 
% steam valve opening affects the tank temperature |T|, while the transfer function
%
% $$ G_d(s) = {e^{-35 s} \over 25s+1}  $$
%
% models how a change |d| in inflow temperature affects |T|.
% To regulate the tank temperature |T| around a given setpoint |Tsp|,
% we can use the following feedback architecture to control the valve 
% opening (voltage |V|): 
%
% <<../Figures/heatex_03.png>>

%%
% *Figure 3*: Feedback Control.

%%
% In this configuration, the proportional-integral (PI) controller
%
% $$ C(s) = K_c (1 + {1 \over \tau_c s} ) $$ 
%
% calculates the voltage |V| based on the gap |Tsp-T| between the desired
% and measured temperatures. You can use the ITAE formulas to pick adequate
% values for the controller parameters:
%
% $$ K_c =  0.859 (\theta / \tau)^{-0.977} , \;\;\; \tau_c = ( \theta / \tau )^{0.680} \tau / 0.674 $$ 
%
Kc = 0.859 * (theta / tau)^(-0.977)
tauc = ( tau / 0.674 ) * ( theta / tau )^0.680
C = Kc * (1 + 1/(tauc*s));

%%
% To see how well the ITAE controller performs, close the feedback loop and
% simulate the response to a set point change:
Tfb = feedback(ss(Gp*C),1);
step(Tfb), grid on
title('Response to step change in temperature setpoint T_{sp}')
ylabel('Tank temperature')

%%
% The response is fairly fast with some overshoot. Looking at the stability
% margins confirms that the gain margin is weak:
margin(Gp*C), grid

%% 
% Reducing the proportional gain |Kc| strengthens stability at the expense
% of performance:
C1 = 0.9 * (1 + 1/(tauc*s));  % reduce Kc from 1.23 to 0.9
margin(Gp*C1), grid

%%
step(Tfb,'b', feedback(ss(Gp*C1),1),'r')
legend('Kc = 1.23','Kc = 0.9')

%% Feedforward Control
% Recall that changes in inflow temperature are the main source of temperature 
% fluctuations in the tank. To reject such disturbances, an alternative to
% feedback control is the feedforward architecture shown below:
%
% <<../Figures/heatex_04.png>>

%%
% *Figure 4*: Feedforward Control.

%%
% In this configuration, the feedforward controller |F| uses measurements
% of the inflow temperature to adjust the steam valve opening (voltage
% |V|). Feedforward control thus anticipates and preempts the effect of
% inflow temperature changes.
%
% Straightforward calculation shows that the overall transfer from
% temperature disturbance |d| to tank temperature |T| is 
%
% $$ T = (G_p F + G_d) d $$
%
% Perfect disturbance rejection requires 
%
% $$ G_p F + G_d = 0  \rightarrow F = -{G_d \over G_p} = - {21.3s+1 \over 25s+1} e^{-20.3 s}$$
%
% In reality, modeling inaccuracies prevent exact disturbance rejection,
% but feedforward control will help minimize temperature fluctuations due
% to inflow disturbances. To get a better sense of how the feedforward
% scheme would perform, increase the ideal feedforward delay by 5 seconds
% and simulate the response to a step change in inflow temperature:
Gd = exp(-35*s)/(25*s+1);
F = -(21.3*s+1)/(25*s+1) * exp(-25*s);
Tff = Gp * ss(F) + Gd;   % d->T transfer with feedforward control

step(Tff), grid
title('Effect of a step disturbance in inflow temperature')
ylabel('Tank temperature')


%% Combined Feedforward-Feedback Control
% Feedback control is good for setpoint tracking in general, while 
% feedforward control can help with rejection of measured disturbances.
% Next we look at the benefits of combining both schemes. The corresponding
% control architecture is shown below:
%
% <<../Figures/heatex_05.png>>

%%
% *Figure 5*: Feedforward-Feedback Control.

%%
% Use |CONNECT| to build the corresponding closed-loop model from |Tsp,d|
% to |T|. First name the input and output channels of each block, then let
% |CONNECT| automatically wire the diagram:
Gd.InputName = 'd';  Gd.OutputName = 'Td';
Gp.InputName = 'V';  Gp.OutputName = 'Tp';
F.InputName = 'd';  F.OutputName = 'Vf';
C.InputName = 'e';  C.OutputName = 'Vc';
Sum1 = sumblk('e','Tsp','T','+-');
Sum2 = sumblk('V','Vf','Vc','++');
Sum3 = sumblk('T','Tp','Td','++');
Tffb = connect(ss(Gp),Gd,C,F,Sum1,Sum2,Sum3,{'Tsp','d'},'T');

%%
% To compare the closed-loop responses with and without feedforward
% control, calculate the corresponding closed-loop transfer function for the
% feedback-only configuration:
C.InputName = 'e';  C.OutputName = 'V';
Tfb = connect(ss(Gp),Gd,C,Sum1,Sum3,{'Tsp','d'},'T');

%%
% Now compare the two designs:
step(Tfb,'b',Tffb,'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH'), grid
title('Closed-loop response to setpoint and disturbance step change')
ylabel('Tank temperature')
legend('Feedback only','Feedforward + feedback')

%%
% The two designs have identical performance for setpoint tracking, 
% but the addition of feedforward control is clearly beneficial for
% disturbance rejection. This is also visible on the closed-loop Bode plot
