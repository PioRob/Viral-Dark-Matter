%% Model Description
% This demo explores the anti-windup capabilities supported by the PID
% Controller block in Simulink(R). The block features two built-in
% anti-windup methods, |back-calculation| and |clamping|, as well as a
% tracking mode to handle more complex scenarios.

%%
% The plant to be controlled is a saturated first-order process with
% dead-time.
%
% We start by opening the model.

open_system('sldemo_antiwindup')

%%
% *Figure 1:* Simulink model of PID control of a plant with input
% saturation.

%%
% To open this model, type |sldemo_antiwindup| in a MATLAB(R) terminal.

%%
% The PID Controller has been tuned with saturation ignored using the
% PID tuner of Simulink(R) Control Design(TM).

%%
% The controlled plant is a first-order process with dead-time described
% by
%
% $$P(s)=\frac{1}{10s+1}e^{-2s}$$
% 
% The plant has known input saturation limits of [-10, 10], which are
% accounted for in the Saturation block labeled Plant Actuator. The PID 
% Controller block in Simulink features two built-in anti-windup methods
% that allow the PID Controller block to account for the available
% information about the plant input saturation.

%% Performance Without Using Anti-Windup
% First, we examine the effect of saturation on the closed-loop when the
% saturation model is not considered by the PID Controller block.
% Simulating the model in Figure 1 generates the results shown below.

open_system('sldemo_antiwindup/Scope');
open_system('sldemo_antiwindup/Scope1'); % This ensures legends get displayed
simout1= sim('sldemo_antiwindup','ReturnWorkspaceOutputs','on');
close_system('sldemo_antiwindup/Scope1');

%%
% *Figure 2:* Setpoint vs. measured output with no anti-windup.

%%

close_system('sldemo_antiwindup/Scope');
open_system('sldemo_antiwindup/Scope1');

%%
% *Figure 3:* Controller output and saturated input with no anti-windup.

%%
% Figures 2 and 3 highlight two of the problems that arise when controlling
% a system with input saturation:
%
% # When the setpoint value is 10, the PID control signal reaches a
% steady-state at about 24, outside the range of the actuator. The
% controller is therefore operating in a nonlinear region where increasing
% the control signal has no effect on the system output, a condition known
% as _winding up_. Note that the dc-gain of the plant is unity, and
% therefore there is no reason for the controller output to have a
% steady-state value outside the actuator's range.
% # When the setpoint value becomes 5, there is a considerable delay before
% the PID controller output returns to within the actuator range.
%
% Designing the PID controller to account for the effect of saturation will
% improve its performance by allowing it to operate in the linear region
% most of the time and recover quickly from nonlinearity. Anti-windup
% circuitry is one way to achieve this.

%% Configuring the Block for Anti-Windup Based on Back-Calculation
% The back-calculation anti-windup method uses a feedback loop to discharge
% the PID Controller's internal integrator when the controller hits
% specified saturation limits and enters nonlinear operation. To enable
% anti-windup, go to the *PID Advanced* tab in the block's dialog; select
% *Limit output*; and enter the plant's saturation limits. Then, select
% *back-calculation* from the *Anti-windup method* menu and specify the
% back-calculation gain |Kb|. The inverse of this gain is the time constant
% of the anti-windup loop. In this demo, the back-calculation gain is
% chosen to be 1. For more information on how to choose this value, see
% Reference [1].

%% Using Tracking Mode to Handle Complex Anti-Windup Scenarios
% The previously discussed anti-windup strategies relied on built-in
% methods to process the saturation information provided to the block via
% its dialog. For those built-in techniques to work as intended, two
% conditions must be met:
%
% # The plant's saturation limits are known and can be entered into the
% dialog of the block.
% # The PID Controller output signal is the only signal feeding the
% actuator.
%
% These conditions may be restrictive when handling general anti-windup
% scenarios. The PID Controller block features a tracking mode that
% allows the user to set up a back-calculation anti-windup loop externally.
% In the rest of the demo, the following two examples are considered to
% illustrate the use of tracking mode for anti-windup purposes:
%
% # Anti-windup for saturated actuators with cascaded dynamics
% # Anti-windup for PID control with Feedforward


%% Constructing Anti-Windup Circuitry for Saturated Actuators with Cascaded Dynamics
% In the following model, the actuator has complex dynamics. This is common
% when an actuator has its own closed-loop dynamics. The PID controller is
% in an outer loop and sees the actuator dynamics as an inner loop, or
% simply a cascaded saturated dynamics as shown in Figure 1.

open_system('sldemo_antiwindupactuator');

%%
% *Figure 11:* Simulink model of PID controller with cascaded actuator
% dynamics.

%%
% To open this model, type |sldemo_antiwindupactuator| in a MATLAB
% terminal.

%%
% In this case, a successful anti-windup strategy requires feeding back the
% actuator output to the tracking port of the PID Controller block as shown
% in Figure 11. To configure the |tracking mode| of the PID Controller
% block, go to the *PID Advanced* tab in the block's dialog; select *Enable
% tracking mode*; and specify the gain |Kt|. The inverse of this gain is
% the time constant of the tracking loop. For more information on how to

%% Constructing Anti-Windup Circuitry for PID Control with Feedforward
% In another common control configuration, the actuator receives a control
% signal that is a combination of a PID control signal and a feedforward
% control signal.

%%
% To accurately build a back-calculation anti-windup loop, the tracking
% signal should subtract the contribution of the feedforward signal. This
