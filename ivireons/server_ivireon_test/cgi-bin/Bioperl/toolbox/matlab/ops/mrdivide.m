%/   Slash or right matrix divide.
%   A/B is the matrix division of B into A, which is roughly the
%   same as A*INV(B) , except it is computed in a different way.
%   More precisely, A/B = (B'\A')'. See MLDIVIDE for details.
%
%   C = MRDIVIDE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A / B' when A or B is an
%   object.
