%XOR Logical EXCLUSIVE OR.
%   XOR(S,T) is the logical symmetric difference of elements S and T.
%   The result is logical 1 (TRUE) where either S or T, but not both, is 
%   nonzero.  The result is logical 0 (FALSE) where S and T are both zero 
%   or nonzero.  S and T must have the same dimensions (or one can be a 
%   scalar).
