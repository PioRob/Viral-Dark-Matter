% This is not documented in R2007b, but if it were, the help would be ...
% g must be an associative binary function, but need not be commutative.
% (Otherwise, you would use a simpler technique.)  online_concatenator computes
% g(x1,...,xk), for k > 0.  This denotes pairwise application of g, but by
% associativity, the result is independent of the tree of binary applications.
% The terminology comes from the fact that concatenation is associative.
% The interesting part is that the x<i> may arrive in any order.  In particular,
% the interface is:
%
%  C = online_concatentor(f); % f is any function handle
%  C.concat(i, x<i>)          % each i in 1,...,k must appear exactly once
%  x = C.final()              % x = f(x1,...,xk);
%
%  If g has an identity element e, then you can also say, the following, and
%  k is allowed to be 0:
%
%  C = online_concatentor(f, e);
%  C.concat(i, x<i>)
%  x = C.final()
%
%  If k = 0, the result is e; otherwise, it is the same as above.

X = cell(1, 0);    % cell array of arguments to g
I = zeros(1, 0);   % indices of pending or active arguments
L = 0;             % current length of A and I

% Elements of I are in increasing order.  We use the convention that I(0) = 0.
% We say that j is "filled" if I(j-1) < I(j)-1.  If L > 0, then L is filled.
% If j < L, it is never the case that j and j+1 are both filled.  If the x<i>
% arrive roughly in order, this rule ensures that X and I are never very long.
% When j is filled, then X{j} is g(x<I(j-1)+1>,...,x<I(j)-1).  After a call on,
% C.concat(i, x<i>), i < L and I is not among the elements of I.  This forces
% x<i> to be accounted for somewhere in X.
