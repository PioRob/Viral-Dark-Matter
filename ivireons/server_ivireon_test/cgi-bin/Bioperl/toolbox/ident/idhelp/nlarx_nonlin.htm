<center><h3>Nonlinear ARX model's Nonlinearity Estimators</h3></center>

<p>Nonlinearity estimators offered in the toolbox for Nonlinear
ARX models and their configurable properties are described below. The options
for selecting the nonlinearity to use and configuring the selected
nonlinearity’s properties are available under the Model Properties (tabbed)
panel under "Configure" panel of the Nonlinear Models window.</p>

<p><b>Wavelet Network</b>: represents a wavelet based network
for nonlinearity </p>

<ul>
 <li>Specify how the number of units should be chosen. The
     first option ("Select automatically") causes the number of units to be
     determined automatically during estimation. A predetermined value may be
     entered by using the second option ("Enter manually"). The third option
     ("Select interactively...") causes a dialog to be shown during estimation
     which shows the bar-plot of unexplained variance as a function of the
     number of units. Click on a bar to view the corresponding fit to working
     data achievable with the chosen number of units. An optimal choice based
     on the generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion is shown in blue. A
     general rule for selection of number of units is to use the smallest
     number of units that capture the essential dynamics.</li>
 <li><a href="wavenet_adv.htm">Advanced properties</a> related to the structure of the
     wavelet network, such as Dilation step and Maximum number of levels, may
     be configured by clicking on the Advanced... button. Follow the link or  see 
     the documentation on "wavenet" for information on these properties.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Tree Partition</b>: represents a binary partition tree
approximation of the nonlinearity</p>

<ul>
 <li>Specify how the number of units should be chosen: The
     first option ("Select automatically") causes the number of units to be
     determined automatically during estimation. A predetermined value may be
     entered by using the second option ("Enter manually"). The default value
     is 10 for this option.</li>
 <li><a href="tree_adv.htm">Advanced properties</a> related to the structure of the tree
     partition, such as Stabilizer and Threshold, may be configured by clicking
     on the Advanced... button. Follow the link or see the documentation 
     on "treepartition" for information on these properties.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Sigmoid Network</b>: represents a sigmoid function based
network for nonlinearity. Specify the number of sigmoid functions (units) to
use in the network.</p>

<p><b>Neural Network</b>: this nonlinearity choice allows
specification of the nonlinearity as a NETWORK object of Neural Network
Toolbox&#8482;. The network object must be created and configured using the functions
in the Neural Network Toolbox. Typically, function <tt>feedforwardnet</tt> or 
<tt>cascadeforwardnet</tt> is used to create NETWORK objects. A configured network object 
must be imported by <a href="nlnetworkimportdlg.htm">clicking on the Import... button<a>. See the 
documentation of "neuralnet" for more information on how to configure the network object.</p>

<p><b>Custom Network</b>: this option allows specification of
the nonlinearity as a network of user-specified ("custom") unit functions. The 
unit function can be <a href="customnetunitfcndlg.htm">specified as a function 
handle or as the name of a MATLAB or MEX-file</a> by clicking on the Browse... button. 
The number of units to use in the network may also be specified (default: 10). </p>

<p><b>None</b>: use this option to remove the nonlinearity
from a particular output channel. Selecting this option is equivalent to
removing the nonlinear block from the Nonlinear ARX model. This may be a natural 
choice if custom regressors have been defined. There are no configurable properties 
associated with this choice. For more information on this choice, 
see documentation on nonlinearity estimator called "linear".</p>
