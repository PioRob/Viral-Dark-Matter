RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
========================================================

To run jobs when a shared file system is present between client and the 
cluster machines, the following files are used:

* pbsSubmitFcn.m
* pbsDecodeFunc.m
* pbsWrapper.sh
* pbsParallelSubmitFcn.m
* pbsParallelDecode.m
* pbsParallelWrapper.sh



RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER DO NOT SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
===============================================================

To run jobs in the absence of a shared file system between client and 
cluster machines, use the files in the subdirectory "nonshared".
