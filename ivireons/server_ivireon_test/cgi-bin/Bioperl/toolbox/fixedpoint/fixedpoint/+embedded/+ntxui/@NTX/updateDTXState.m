% So to be sure we lock the axis in this case, we set axis lock when
% turning on DTX, and vice-versa, if the mouse is already inside axes.

% Update over/underflow arrow colors that appear when display
% is locked and new bin data appears before/after axis limits.
% That display is color coded when DTX is on, or blue when off.
% If the display is locked and DTX is toggles, the color needs to change
% dynamically while remaining locked.  A subtle issue, but leads to a
% highly consistent display.
