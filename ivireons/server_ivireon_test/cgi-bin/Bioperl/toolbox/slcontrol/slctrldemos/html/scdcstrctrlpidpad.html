%% Introduction of the PID Controller (2DOF) Block
% With a 2DOF PID controller, also known as ISA-PID controller, you can
% achieve good performance for both reference tracking and disturbance
% rejection.  It contains a standard PID controller in the feedback loop
% and adds a pre-filter to the reference signal.  The pre-filter helps
% produce a smoother transient response to set-point changes.  In this
% example, you use a Simulink(R) PID Controller (2DOF) block to control a
% continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and you design this 2DOF PID
% controller in the PID Tuner. 
%
% A typical design workflow with the PID Tuner involves the following
% tasks: 
%
% (1) Launch the PID Tuner.  When launching, the software automatically
% computes a linear plant model from the Simulink model and designs an
% initial controller.  
%
% (2) Tune the controller in the PID Tuner by manually adjusting design
% criteria in two design modes. The tuner computes PID parameters that
% robustly stabilize the system.     
%
% (3) Export the parameters of the designed controller back to the PID
% Controller block and verify controller performance in Simulink.

%% Opening the Model
% Take a few moments to explore the model. 
%%
% <matlab:open_system('scdcstrctrlpidblock') Open the CSTR control model>
open_system('scdcstrctrlpidblock');

%%
% The CSTR plant is initialized at an equilibrium operating point.  The
% nominal value of the residual concentration is 1.96 mol/L, which is the
% initial condition of the |Residual Concentration Reference| block and the
% |Integrator1| block in the |CSTR| subsystem.  

%%
% The initial condition of the integrator *I0* in the PID controller block
% is determined by the equilibrium operating point.  In this example, since
% we have a PI controller in parallel form, 
%
%     I0 = u0 - ((b-1)*y0*P)
% 
% where *u0* is the steady state controller output (300), and *y0* is the
% steady state plant output (1.96).  Since *b* is 1, *I0*=*u0*=300.

% 2nd Ed., 2004, Wiley, pp.34-36.
%

%% Design Overview
% In this example, control the residual concentration of the CSTR by
% manipulating reactor coolant temperature.  The overall design
% requirements are:  
%
% * Track a sudden decrease of 0.5 in the reference signal from a Simulink
% step block |Residual Concentration Reference|.  The detailed design
% requirements are: 
%%
%           Settling time under 10 seconds
%%
%           Zero steady-state error to the step reference input
%%
%           Overshoot below 0.1
%%
% * Reject a 5 degree sudden increase in the feed temperature from a
% Simulink step block |Feed Temperature|.  The detailed design requirements
% are: 
%%
%           Settling time under 10 seconds
%%
%           Peak deviation from steady state below 0.1
%
% In this example you design a PI controller |PID Controller (2DOF)| in the
% PID Tuner to achieve good responses in both reference tracking and
% disturbance rejection.

%% Opening the PID Tuner
% To launch the PID Tuner, double-click the PID Controller block to open
% its block dialog.  In the *Main* tab, click *Tune*.
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_blockdialog.png>>
%%
% After you launch the PID Tuner, close the PID block dialog and move the
% PID Tuner beside the Simulink model.  Also, open the residual
% concentration scope window.  

%% Initial PID Design
% When the PID Tuner launches, the software computes a linearized plant
% model.  The software automatically identifies the plant input and output,
% and uses the current operating point for the linearization.  The plant
% can have any order and can have time delays.        
%
% The PID Tuner computes an initial PI controller to achieve a reasonable
% tradeoff between performance and robustness. By default, step reference
% tracking performance displays in the plot.  
%
% Click the *Show parameters* arrow to view controller parameters P, I, b,
% and a set of performance and robustness measurements.  In this example,
% the initial PI controller design gives a settling time of 4.4 second,
% which meets the requirement.    
%% 
% The following figure shows the PID Tuner dialog with initial design:
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_initialtuner.png>>
%%
% To test the initial design on the nonlinear model, click *Apply* in the
% PID Tuner.  This writes the parameters back to the PID block in the
% Simulink model.  Run a simulation and view the closed-loop response:  
%%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_analysisresp1.png>>
%%
% The transient response of disturbance rejection shows that its peak
% deviation is about 0.2, which exceeds the design requirement. You need to
% reduce the peak deviation by at least 50% using the PID Tuner.    

%% Design for Disturbance Rejection in the Basic Design Mode
% The PID Tuner provides step plot for different loop responses such as
% reference tracking (from r to y) and controller efforts (from r to u),
% etc. In this example since the disturbance occurs at the reactor feed
% temperature, the closest plot you can get is the input disturbance
% rejection plot that assumes a step disturbance occurs at the input of the
% plant model.
%% 
% The following figure shows the disturbance rejection performance with
% initial controller:
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_disturbance1.png>>
%%
% You need to reduce the peak deviation from -0.019 to -0.009 (about 50%).
% First, try to reduce the peak deviation using the Basic design mode,
% which is the mode selected when the Tuner opens. Move the response time
% slider to the right to decrease the response time and make controller
% more aggressive.  But you cannot meet the design requirements because
% reducing the peak deviation makes the settling time too long. To return
% to the initial automated design result, click the |reset| button in the
% toolbar that is the last button with green arrow.
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_disturbance2.png>>

%% Design for Disturbance Rejection in the Extended Design Mode
% In the PID Tuner Extended design mode, you have more flexibility to
% adjust controller performance.  You need some knowledge of frequency
% domain control design technology to take full advantage of this design
% mode.    
%
% To switch to the Extended design mode, select *Extended* in the *Design
% Mode* dropdown menu in the toolbar.
%% 
% The following figure shows the PID Tuner in Extended design mode with the
% initial design: 
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_disturbance3.png>>
%%
% Increasing the bandwidth makes the controller more aggressive and reduces
% the peak deviation.  To maintain the settling time of disturbance
% rejection below 10 seconds, you also need to reduce the desired phase 
% margin.  This is a typical tradeoff between performance and robustness in
% controller design.  View the effects of your change in the response plot.
% You can move both sliders to reduce the peak deviation to 0.007 while
% maintain the settling time within 10 seconds.  One way to achieve this
% is:
%% 
% * Bandwidth of 4 rad/sec
% * Phase margin of 25 degree

%% 
% The following figure shows disturbance rejection performance: 
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_disturbance4.png>>
%%
% To test the new design on the nonlinear model, click *Apply* in the PID
% Tuner.  Run a simulation and view the closed-loop response:
%%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_analysisresp2.png>>
%%
% The disturbance rejection performance satisfies the requirements.
% However, because the controller is very aggressive, the overshoot of
% reference tracking exceeds the limit.  You need to adjust the pre-filter
% in the 2DOF PID block to improve the reference tracking performance.

%% Completing PID Design with Set-point Weighting
% The parameter *b* in an ISA PI or PID controller is the set-point weight
% on the reference signal feeding into the proportional gain of the
% controller.  It has a range between 0 and 1, and its default value is 1.
% By reducing its value, the reference tracking performance becomes
% smoother.  In this example, open the PID block dialog and set *b* to 0.
%
% Because *b* and *P* are changed, you need to adjust the initial condition
% of the integrator *I0* in the PID controller block to make sure the
% initial operating point is still at equilibrium.  Since the relationship
% is
%
%     I0 = u0 - ((b-1)*y0*P)
% 
% where *u0* is 300 and *y0* is 1.96.  With *P* from PID Tuner (-153.5) and
% *b* from manual adjustment (0), *I0* becomes -0.8267.  Update the initial
% condition of the integrator with this value and the simulation will start
% at the equilibrium operating point.
%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_updatedblockdialog.png>>
%%
% The following figure shows that there is no overshoot in reference
% tracking with the updated design.      
%%
% <<../html_extra/scdcstrctrlpidblock/pid_analysisresp3.png>>
%%
% In summary, to design a 2DOF PID controller with balanced performance in
% reference tracking and disturbance rejection, use the PID Tuner to
% achieve good disturbance rejection and then manually adjust set-point
% weights *b* and/or *c* in the block dialog to achieve good reference
% tracking.  Notice that changing *b* and *c* does not affect closed-loop
% stability or disturbance rejection performance.
