</pre><h2>Watterson Channel Model<a name="3"></a></h2><p>The Watterson channel model consists of a tapped delay line, where each tap corresponds to a resolvable propagation path.  On each tap, two magneto-ionic components are present: each one is modeled as a complex Gaussian random process with a given gain and frequency shift, and whose Doppler spectrum is Gaussian with a given standard deviation [2]. Hence, each tap is characterized by a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum, which consists of two Gaussian functions in the frequency domain, each one with its own set of parameters (power gain, frequency shift, and standard deviation).</p><p>In this demo, we follow the Watterson simulation model specified in [1], in which the complex fading process on each tap is obtained by adding two independent frequency-shifted complex Gaussian random processes (with Gaussian Doppler spectra) corresponding to the two magneto-ionic components.  This simulation model leads to a complex fading process whose envelope is in general <i>not</i> Rayleigh distributed.  Hence, to be faithful to the simulation model, we cannot simply generate a Rayleigh channel with a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum.  Instead, we generate two independent Rayleigh channels, each with a frequency-shifted Gaussian Doppler spectrum, gain-scale them, and add them together to obtain the Watterson channel model with a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum.  For simplicity, we simulate a Watterson channel with only one tap.</p><p>A frequency-shifted Gaussian Doppler spectrum can be seen as a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum in which only one Gaussian function is present (the second one having a zero power gain).  Hence, to emulate the frequency-shifted Gaussian Doppler spectrum of each magneto-ionic component, we construct a bi-Gaussian Doppler object such that one of the two Gaussian functions has the specified frequency shift and standard deviation, while the other has a zero power gain.</p><p>The first magneto-ionic component has a Gaussian Doppler spectrum with standard deviation <tt>sGauss1</tt>, frequency shift <tt>fGauss1</tt>, and power gain <tt>gGauss1</tt>.  A bi-Gaussian Doppler object <tt>dop1</tt> is constructed such that the second Gaussian function has a zero power gain (its standard deviation and center frequency are hence irrelevant, and take on default values), while the first Gaussian function has a normalized standard deviation <tt>sGauss1/fd</tt> and a normalized frequency shift <tt>fGauss1/fd</tt>, where the normalization factor <tt>fd</tt> is the maximum Doppler shift of the corresponding channel.  In this example, since the gain of the second Gaussian function is zero, the value assigned to the gain of the first Gaussian function is irrelevant (we leave it to its default value of 0.5), because the associated channel object created later normalizes the Doppler spectrum to have a total power of 1.</p><p>Type <tt>help doppler.bigaussian</tt> for more information on how to construct a bi-Gaussian Doppler object.</p><pre class="codeinput">fd = 10;                        <span class="comment">% Chosen maximum Doppler shift for simulation</span>

%% ITU-R HF Channel Models: Overview
% In HF ionospheric radio communications, the transmitted signal can bounce
% off several times from the E and F layers of the ionosphere, which
% results in several propagation paths, also called modes [1].
% Typically, the multipath delay spreads are large, as compared to mobile
% radio.  Also, the signal can suffer from Doppler spread due to the
% turbulence of the ionosphere.  However, the fading rate is usually smaller
% than for mobile radio.
%
% Recommendation ITU-R F.1487 [1] proposes a general Gaussian scatter model
% for the simulation of HF ionospheric channels.  This model is based on
% Watterson's channel model [2].  Simpler models are also proposed in [1]
% for use in HF modem tests, with specified parameters. 


%% Initialization of Simulation-Specific Parameters 
% The simulation sampling rate is specified, and kept the same for the
% remainder of the demo.  The input to the channel simulator is oversampled
% by a factor of four.

%% Watterson Channel Model
% The Watterson channel model consists of a tapped delay line, where each
% tap corresponds to a resolvable propagation path.  On each tap, two
% magneto-ionic components are present: each one is modeled as a complex
% Gaussian random process with a given gain and frequency shift, and whose 
% Doppler spectrum is Gaussian with a given standard deviation [2].
% Hence, each tap is characterized by a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum, which
% consists of two Gaussian functions in the frequency domain, each one with
% its own set of parameters (power gain, frequency shift, and standard
% deviation).

%%
% In this demo, we follow the Watterson simulation model specified in [1],
% in which the complex fading process on each tap is obtained by adding two
% independent frequency-shifted complex Gaussian random processes (with
% Gaussian Doppler spectra) corresponding to the two magneto-ionic
% components.  This simulation model leads to a complex fading process
% whose envelope is in general _not_ Rayleigh distributed.  Hence, to be
% faithful to the simulation model, we cannot simply generate a Rayleigh
% channel with a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum.  Instead, we generate two
% independent Rayleigh channels, each with a frequency-shifted Gaussian
% Doppler spectrum, gain-scale them, and add them together to obtain the
% Watterson channel model with a bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum.  For
% simplicity, we simulate a Watterson channel with only one tap.

%%
% A frequency-shifted Gaussian Doppler spectrum can be seen as a
% bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum in which only one Gaussian function is
% present (the second one having a zero power gain).  Hence, to emulate the
% frequency-shifted Gaussian Doppler spectrum of each magneto-ionic
% component, we construct a bi-Gaussian Doppler object such that one of the
% two Gaussian functions has the specified frequency shift and standard
% deviation, while the other has a zero power gain.

%%
% The first magneto-ionic component has a Gaussian Doppler spectrum with
% standard deviation |sGauss1|, frequency shift |fGauss1|, and power gain
% |gGauss1|.  A bi-Gaussian Doppler object |dop1| is constructed such that
% the second Gaussian function has a zero power gain (its standard
% deviation and center frequency are hence irrelevant, and take on default

%% ITU-R F.1487 Low Latitudes, Moderate Conditions (LM) Channel Model
% Recommendation ITU-R F.1487 specifies simplified channel models used in
% the quantitative testing of HF modems.  These models consist of two
% independently fading paths with equal power.  On each path, the two
% magneto-ionic components are assumed to have zero frequency shift and
% equal variance: hence the bi-Gaussian Doppler spectrum on each tap
% reduces to a single Gaussian Doppler spectrum, and the envelope of the
% complex fading process is Rayleigh-distributed.
%
% Below, we construct a channel object according to the Low Latitudes,
% Moderate Conditions (LM) channel model specified in Annex 3 of ITU-R
% F.1487.  The path delays are 0 and 2 ms.  The frequency spread, defined as
% twice the standard deviation of the Gaussian Doppler spectrum, is 1.5 Hz.
% The Gaussian Doppler spectrum object is hence constructed with a
% normalized standard deviation of (1.5/2)/ |fd|, where |fd| is chosen as 1 for
% simplicity (type |help doppler.gaussian| for more information).
