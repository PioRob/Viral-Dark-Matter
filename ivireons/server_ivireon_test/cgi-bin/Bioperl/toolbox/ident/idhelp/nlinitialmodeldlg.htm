<title>Help: Initial Model Specification Dialog</title>
<body>

<center><h3>Initial Model Specification Dialog</h3></center>

<p>This dialog is launched by clicking on the "Initialize..." button located 
in the top-right portion of the "Configure" panel of the Nonlinear Models window.</p>

<p> This dialog facilitates the initialization of the properties of the 
    chosen model type using an existing model of the same type and matching I/O 
    dimensions. 
</p>

<p> Select an existing model from the "Initial Model" popup menu. Some information 
    on the selected model, such as its orders and the type of nonlinearity, is 
    shown in the information box beneath the popup menu. Only the models of the 
    right type and of I/O dimensions matching those of the working data are 
    offered for selection in this popup menu. The models to choose from must be 
    available in the model board of the GUI. If not, they should be first imported 
    using the "Import models" popup menu in System Identification Tool's main window.
</p>

<p> If you want to use the <a href="nlalgorithm.htm">algorithm settings</a> 
    associated with the selected model for your current estimation, click on 
    the checkbox ("Inherit the model's algorithm properties."). 
</p>

<p> Click on the OK button to apply the settings from this dialog and close 
    the dialog. Click on the Cancel button to dismiss the dialog without applying 
    these settings. Click on the Help button to view this help page.
</p>

<p> Note that initialization of the model using this dialog is optional. 
    In the most basic usage scenario, the initialization option is not exercised. 
    This option is useful for continuing iterations or refinement on a previously 
    estimated or imported model.
