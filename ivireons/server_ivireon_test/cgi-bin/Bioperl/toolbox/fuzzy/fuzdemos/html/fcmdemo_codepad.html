% Clustering of numerical data forms the basis of many classification and
% system modeling algorithms. The purpose of clustering is to identify 
% natural groupings of data from a large data set to produce a concise 
% representation of a system's behavior. 
%
%% What Is Fuzzy C-Means Clustering? 
% Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a data clustering technique in which a dataset is
% grouped into n clusters with every datapoint in the dataset belonging to
% every cluster to a certain degree. For example, a certain datapoint that
% lies close to the center of a cluster will have a high degree of
% belonging or membership to that cluster and another datapoint that lies
% far away from the center of a cluster will have a low degree of belonging
% or membership to that cluster.
%
% The Fuzzy Logic Toolbox(TM) function |fcm| performs FCM clustering. It starts with an initial 
% guess for the cluster centers, which are intended to mark the mean 
% location of each cluster. The initial guess for these cluster centers is 
% most likely incorrect. Next, |fcm| assigns every data point a membership
% grade for each cluster. By iteratively updating the cluster centers and
% the membership grades for each data point, |fcm| iteratively  moves the
% cluster centers to the right location within a data set. This  iteration
% is based on minimizing an objective function that represents  the
% distance from any given data point to a cluster center weighted by  that
% data point's membership grade. 
%
%% Interactive FCM Clustering Demo
% Using the <matlab:fcmdemo fcmdemo> command, you can launch a GUI that lets you try out 
% various parameter settings for the fuzzy c-means algorithm and observe 
% the effect on the resulting 2-D clustering. You can choose a sample 
% data set and an arbitrary number of 
% clusters from the drop down menus on the right, and then click "Start" to 
% start the fuzzy clustering process. The clustering itself is performed by
% the |fcm| function.

%%
% Once the clustering is done, you can select one of the clusters by 
% clicking on it, and view the membership function surface by clicking the 
% "Plot MF" button. To get a better viewing angle, click and drag inside
% the figure to rotate the MF surface.
%
%%
% You can also tune the 3 optional parameters for the FCM algorithm 
% (exponent, maximum number of iterations and minimum amount of 
% improvement) from the demo GUI and observe how the clustering process is 
% consequently altered.
%
%% Performing FCM Clustering on Your Own Data
% The function |fcm| takes a data set and a desired number of clusters
% and returns optimal cluster centers and membership grades for each data
% point. You can use this information to build a fuzzy inference system by creating 
% membership functions that represent the fuzzy qualities of each cluster.
%
% Here is the underlying code that performs the clustering. 

data = load('fcmdata.dat');  % load some sample data
n_clusters = 3;              % number of clusters
[center,U,obj_fcn] = fcm(data, n_clusters);
