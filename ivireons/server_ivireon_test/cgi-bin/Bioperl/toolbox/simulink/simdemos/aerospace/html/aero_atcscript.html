%% Air Traffic Control Radar Design

% This model is a conceptual air traffic control (ATC) radar
% simulation based on the radar range equation.

%% Model Description
%
% To make parameters easier to change and easier to determine their values, 
% a GUI is supplied with this model. Radar and weather parameters may be
% changed from this GUI. While simulating, the effects of these
% parameters can be seen on the scope display which shows the
% actual aircraft range in yellow and the estimated aircraft range
% from the radar in magenta. Another output that can be viewed is
% the calculated signal to noise ratio (SNR) is compared to the
% ideal SNR. Ideal SNR is also specified from the GUI. The result
% is shown in the display block and will be either 1 (SNR >= ideal 
% SNR) or 0 (SNR < ideal SNR).
% 
% Simulink(R) and Stateflow(R) are used in the model, which is divided into 
% three main subsystems, radar, aircraft, and weather.
% 
% Using subsystems is helpful in two ways: the model is organized
% and easier to understand and the work can be split between
% multiple engineers by subsystems. The Stateflow machine labeled
% "check SNR" performs the logic comparing calculated SNR to the 
% ideal SNR and output data based on this comparison.
% 
% You can run the simulation to determine if the radar can pick up 
% the aircraft by the output on the scope. Using the GUI, the radar 
% and the weather parameters can be altered and will change the range
% where the aircraft can be "seen".

%% Design Issues
%
% Radar systems are designed for a specific purpose and can very
% seldom be used for other applications effectively. Each new radar
% specification requires the computation of new parameter values. When 
% designing a radar for an application, there are a number of parameters 
% which shape the design. Some of these parameters are contained or
% derived logically from the customer specification. Others are
% selected arbitrarily using the design engineer's best judgement.
% This is the first approximate solution for the system design.
% From here, continual refinement of the design parameters takes
% place until an optimum design is reached. If any changes occur in
% the customer specification, it could cause a need to rework the
% design process over from the beginning.  The parametric nature
% of this design strategy lends itself to automation.

%% Design Specification
% 
% We're interested in performing conceptual design for a
% ground-based air traffic control (ATC) radar. Let's take a look
% at a potential customer specification.
% 
% <<../images/atc_Image2.gif>>
% 
% This is an example of a customer specification upon which a
% design process would be based. The customer, possibly the FAA,
% provides some basic requirements for the radar design leaving a
% number of parameter selections up to the design engineer.
% 
% It should be noted that some of the logically derived
% parameters are dependent on assumptions made by the engineer and
% would need to be re-calculated each time the best-judgement
% parameters are optimized. This problem lends itself well to
% simulation. By using Simulink and Stateflow, the design engineer
% has the analysis capability to have time-varying design cases
% for Monte Carlo test runs, i.e.: aircraft cross-sections and
% locations, weather cross-sections, and locations.
% 

%% MathWorks(R) Products in the Design Process
% 
% Here's how MathWorks(R) products fit the job of conceptual
% radar design:
% 
% <<../images/atc_Image1.gif>>
% 
% Using the customer specification and the radar range equations
% along with equations describing the physics of the system, a
% model is built in MATLAB(R), Simulink, and Stateflow. Using the
% model with the sim command for batch runs, those best-judgement 
% parameters can be optimized for various conditions, weather, aircraft, 
% using a Monte Carlo simulation run to prove robustness. The result is 
% a set of optimized radar parameters that can be used to build a detailed 
% block diagram model of the full radar system for further system analysis 
% in Simulink with the Signal Processing Blockset(TM).
