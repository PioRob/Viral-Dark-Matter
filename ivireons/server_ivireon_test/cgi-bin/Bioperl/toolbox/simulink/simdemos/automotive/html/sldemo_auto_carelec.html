%% System Components
%
% The system simulated consists of the following component parts: 
%
% A separately excited DC motor with constant field excitation. The 
% armature is supplied from a DC source voltage (battery nominal voltage 
% 240V) and seeing that the field excitation, and hence current, is kept 
% constant the motor speed is directly proportional to the applied armature
% voltage. This arrangement simulates the engine of the car, which drives 
% the alternator (synchronous generator) via a belt and pulley mechanism. 
% As the driver accelerates, the engine speed changes as does the speed of 
% rotation of the alternator. Therefore to simulate a change in engine 
% speed, the armature voltage of the DC motor is changed.         
%
% The DC motor output power (product of motor torque and angular speed, w) 
% is fed into the synchronous machine block as an input.       
%
% The alternator is a 3 phase synchronous generator with its field current 
% regulated to give control over the output voltage. This is simulated by 
% using the Simplified Synchronous Machine model.      
%
% The 3 phase AC output of the alternator is fed into the 6 pulse rectifier
% to give the DC voltage required to charge the car battery and to supply 
% the balance of the electrical system of the car. 
%

%% Operation of the System
%
% The DC voltage must be kept constant so that the lights do not dim when 
% other loads are switched on, for example: the starter motor or windscreen
% wiper motor. Likewise, if the A/C fan motor is running and the lights are
% switched on the fan motor must not slow down. 
%
% To ensure the DC voltage remains constant, even when the engine speed 
% changes or when additional electrical loads are switched on, it is 
% necessary to feed back the DC bus voltage and regulate the alternator 
% generated AC voltage accordingly. The following events will help 
% illustrate this operation: 
%
% * Speed variation: While the simulation is running, reduce the input DC
% battery voltage from 240 to say 150 V. When the simulation is over, 
% display the DC bus voltage and the speed w of the DC motor. It is seen 
% that the speed changes, but there is no change in the DC bus voltage.
%
% * Load variation: While the simulation is running, change the value of
% the load resistor connected across the DC busbar. Display the DC bus 
% voltage and current. The current changes with the load, but the voltage 
% remains constant (as it should).
%
% * To illustrate that the voltage regulator on the alternator is
% operating, change the constant on the second summer (the one with the 
% two +ve signs) while the simulation is running. Display the AC and DC 
% voltages and they will show the changes.
