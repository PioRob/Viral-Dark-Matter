<center><h2>Nonlinear Models</h2></center>

<p> Nonlinear Models window is opened by choosing the corresponding
    option in the pop-up menu Estimate in the System Identification Tool window.
    The Nonlinear Models window facilitates estimation of nonlinear black box
    models – Nonlinear ARX and Hammerstein-Wiener models. It operates on Working
    Data in the System Identification Tool window to perform the estimation.
</p>

<p>This window contains two tabbed panels titled <a
    href="#_Model_Type">Configure</a> and <a href="#_Estimation">Estimate</a>.
    "Configure" panel allows selection of a model type and configuring its 
    properties for estimation. The "Estimate" panel shows information on estimation 
    progress and results. The estimation algorithm options and model refinement options 
    are also accessible from this panel.
</p>

<p><b>Basic use</b>: From the "Configure" panel, select the type
    of model (Nonlinear ARX or Hammerstein-Wiener) to estimate. You may
    optionally set the name of the model to estimate. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>In case of Nonlinear ARX model structure, specify the
        orders for regressors (under Regressors tab) and the type of nonlinearity
        for the nonlinear block (under Model Properties tab). </li>
    <li>In case of Hammerstein-Wiener models, specify the type of
        nonlinearity to use for each I/O channel (under I/O Nonlinearity tab) and
        the order of the linear model (under Linear Block tab). </li>
</ul>

<p>After selecting the model structure and configuring its properties 
    (as specified above), press the Estimate button. This causes the estimation
    of selected model type to start. If estimation is iterative in nature, the Estimate
    button changes into a Stop button. Pressing the stop button causes the estimation
    to stop prematurely (soon after finishing the running iteration). When
    estimation completes, the estimated model is inserted into the model board of
    the System Identification Tool window. Information about the characteristics of
    the estimated model and goodness of fit are available under the "Estimate"
    panel of the Nonlinear Models window.</p>

<p><b>Next steps in the System Identification Tool window</b>: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The inserted model’s response may be compared against the
        validation data by checking the Model output checkbox in the System
        Identification Tool window. </li>
    <li>Step response of the nonlinear model may be obtained by
        checking the Transient resp checkbox. </li>
    <li>The shape of the nonlinearity can be explored by using the
        checkbox options for Nonlinear ARX and Hammerstein-Wiener models in the GUI.
    </li>
    <li>Dragging the model icon into the LTI Viewer box opens the
        LTI Viewer showing the response plots for the linear approximation of
        the nonlinear model for the input of the current Working Data (see 
        documentation on function LINAPP for more information).</li>
</ul>

<center><h3><a name="_Model_Type"></a>Configure</h3></center>

<p>The "Configure" panel’s contents are divided into two parts –
    a common top part allows selection of the model type for estimation,
    choosing model name and optionally, initializing the model. 
    The contents of the bottom half of the panel are dependent on the choice of 
    model type. This part of the panel contains options for configuring the properties 
of the selected model type (Nonlinear ARX or Hammerstein-Wiener).</p>

<p>Top panel choices: </p>

<p><b>Model type</b>: Choose either Nonlinear ARX (default)
    or Hammerstein-Wiener as a model type to estimate from the popup menu.
</p>

<p><b>Model name</b>: A default name for the model to be estimated already exists. 
    If you want to change it, click on the pencil-shaped icon next to the model name.
    The specified name must be different from the names of the existing models 
    (in the GUI’s model board) of the same type. 
</p>

<p><a name=initialmodelbutton><b>Model initialization</b></a>: An
    existing model from the System Identification Tool’s window may be used for initializing
    the configuration and parameter values of the model to be estimated. Clicking on the 
    "Initialize..." button launches a <a href="nlinitialmodeldlg.htm">dialog</a> that allows 
    choosing an existing model of the matching dimensions. You may also use the 
    estimation algorithm settings from the chosen model for the current estimation. Only the 
    models of the right type and of I/O dimensions matching those of the working data 
    will be offered for selection in this dialog. The models to choose from must be 
    available in the model board of the GUI. If not, they should be first imported using 
    the "Import models" popup menu in System Identification Tool's main window.
    
    Note that initialization is optional. This option is useful for continuing iterations 
    or refinement on a previously estimated model.

<center><h3><a name="_Estimation"></a>Estimate</h3></center>

<p>"Estimate" panel of the Nonlinear Models window shows
    information about the current estimation and the characteristics of the
    estimated model. It also allows setting algorithm properties that control the
    behavior of iterative estimation methods. When Estimate button is pressed, this
panel gains focus automatically. </p>

<p>"Estimate" panel contains the following components:</p>

<p><b>Estimation Trace</b>: For iterative estimation schemes,
    this table shows the estimation progress. For more information on displayed
information, <a href="nlalgorithm.htm">click here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Estimation Report</b>: This text area shows a report on
    the estimation. It shows the model configuration before estimation, the
    duration of estimation and reason for termination (in case of iterative schemes)
    and the result of estimation. Results include a quantitative measure of the
    model quality in terms of goodness of fit to estimation data, final
    prediction error (FPE) and the loss function (cost). This information is also
    summarized in a separate “Estimation Summary” displayed on the top right
    portion of the "Estimate" panel. The estimation report also includes some post-estimation
    information on the model, such as names of regressors used in the nonlinear
    block of a Nonlinear ARX model. The report ends with some suggestions on potential
next steps.</p>

<p><b>Algorithm Options</b>: Clicking on Algorithm options
    button opens a dialog where properties of the estimation algorithm may be
    configured. Most of these properties pertain to iterative estimation schemes and
    these settings are ignored by the non-iterative estimation schemes (such as
    estimation of a Nonlinear ARX model with Tree Partition nonlinearity). For
details on algorithm options, <a href="nlalgorithm.htm">click here</a>. </p>

<p><b>Model Refinement</b>: These options
    pertain to estimation continuation and are meaningful for <a
        href="nlitervsnoniter.htm">iterative estimation schemes</a> only. If at least one 
    model has been estimated, the last estimated model may be refined to achieve better accuracy. 
    The name of the last estimated model in the current session is shown in the first line in Model 
    Refinement group box. If no model has been estimated yet, or if the last estimated model has been 
deleted or renamed, the last estimated model is shown as "&lt;none&gt;".</p>

<ul>
    <li>Checking the options "Use last estimated model as initial model for next estimation" 
        causes the model for next estimation to be initialized using the last estimated model. 
        This allows easy continuation of iterations without having to start from scratch when 
        trying to achieve improved results. If you make any changes to the model's configuration
        from the "Configure" tab, this checkbox would become unchecked and a warning dialog would
        be shown.
    </li>
    <li>The option "Randomize initial model before estimation" causes
        the parameters of the model to be perturbed about their
        current values. This can help in improving the estimation results if the
        current (iterative) estimation stopped because the estimation scheme got
        stuck in a local minima. This option is enabled only if the option for using 
    the last estimated model as initial model (first checkbox) has been selected.</li>
</ul>
