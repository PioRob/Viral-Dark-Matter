%% Data Type Independent Code for CORDIC QR Factorization
% A good way to write an algorithm intended for a fixed-point target is to
% write it in MATLAB(R) using builtin floating-point types so you can verify
% that the algorithm works.  When you refine the algorithm to work with
% fixed-point types, then the best thing to do is to write it so that the
% same code continues working with floating-point.  That way, when you are
% debugging, then you can switch the inputs back and forth between
% floating-point and fixed-point types to determine if a difference in
% behavior is because of fixed-point effects such as overflow and
% quantization versus an algorithmic difference.  Even if the algorithm is
% not well suited for a floating-point target (as is the case of using CORDIC
% in the following example), it is still advantageous to have your MATLAB
% code work with floating-point for debugging purposes.
%
% In contrast, you may have a completely different strategy if your target is
% floating point.  For example, the QR algorithm is often done in
% floating-point with Householder transformations and row or column pivoting.
% But in fixed-point it is often more efficient to use CORDIC to apply Givens
% rotations with no pivoting.
%
% This demo addresses the first case, where your target is fixed-point, and
% you want an algorithm that is independent of data type because it is easier
% to develop and debug.
%
% In this demo you will learn various coding methods that can be applied
% across systems.  The significant design patterns used in this demo are the
% following:
%
% * Data Type Independence: the algorithm is written in such a way that the
% MATLAB(R) code is independent of data type, and will work equally well for
% <matlab:doc('fi'); fixed-point>,
% <matlab:doc('double'); double-precision floating-point>, and
% <matlab:doc('single'); single-precision floating-point>.
% * Overflow Prevention: method to guarantee
% not to overflow. This demonstrates how to prevent overflows in fixed-point.
% * Solving Systems of Equations: method to use computational efficiency. Narrow your
% code scope by isolating what you need to define.
%
% The main example in this demo is an implementation of the
% <matlab:doc('qr'); QR>
% factorization in fixed-point arithmetic using CORDIC for the Givens rotations.
% The algorithm is written in such a way that the MATLAB code is independent of
% data type, and will work equally well for fixed-point, double-precision
% floating-point, and single-precision floating-point.
%
% The <matlab:doc('qr'); QR>
% factorization of M-by-N matrix A produces an M-by-N upper triangular matrix R
% and an M-by-M orthogonal matrix Q such that |A = Q*R|.  A matrix is upper
% triangular if it has all zeros below the diagonal.  An M-by-M matrix Q is
% orthogonal if |Q'*Q =|
% <matlab:doc('eye'); |eye|> |(M)|,
% the identity matrix.
%
% The QR factorization is widely used in least-squares problems, such
% as the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm used in adaptive
% filters.
%
% The CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm is
% attractive for computing the QR algorithm in fixed-point because you
% can apply orthogonal Givens rotations with CORDIC using only shift
% and add operations.

%% Defining the CORDIC QR Algorithm
% The CORDIC QR algorithm is given in the following MATLAB(R)
% function, where A is an M-by-N real matrix, and |niter| is the number
% of CORDIC iterations.  Output Q is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
% R is an M-by-N upper-triangular matrix such that |Q*R = A|.
%
%  function [Q,R] = cordicqr(A,niter)
%    Kn = inverse_cordic_growth_constant(niter);
%    [m,n] = size(A);
%    R = A;
%    Q = eml.nullcopy(repmat(A(:,1),1,m)); % Declare type and size of Q
%    Q(:) = eye(m);                        % Initialize Q
%    for j=1:n
%      for i=j+1:m
%        [R(j,j:end),R(i,j:end),Q(:,j),Q(:,i)] = ...
%            cordicgivens(R(j,j:end),R(i,j:end),Q(:,j),Q(:,i),niter,Kn);
%      end
%    end
%  end
%
%
% This function was written to be independent of data type.  It works equally
% well with builtin floating-point types (double and single) and with the
% fixed-point
% <matlab:doc('fi'); |fi|> object.
%
% One of the trickiest aspects of writing data-type independent code is to
% specify data type and size for a new variable.  In order to preserve data
% types without having to explicitly specify them, the output R was set to be
% the same as input A, like this:
%
%      R = A;
%
% In addition to being data-type independent, this function was written in such
% a way that Embedded MATLAB(R) will be able to generate efficient C code from
% it.  In MATLAB, you most often declare and initialize a variable in one step,
% like this:
%
%      Q = eye(m)
%
% However, |Q=eye(m)| would always produce Q as a double-precision floating point
% variable.  If A is fixed-point, then we want Q to be fixed-point; if A is
% single, then we want Q to be single; etc.
%
% Hence, you need to declare the type and size of Q in one step, and then
% initialize it in a second step.  This gives Embedded MATLAB the information
% it needs to create an efficient C program with the correct types and sizes.
% In the finished code you initialize output Q to be an M-by-M identity
% matrix and the same data type as A, like this:
%
%      Q = eml.nullcopy(repmat(A(:,1),1,m)); % Declare type and size of Q
%      Q(:) = eye(m);                        % Initialize Q
%
% The <matlab:doc('eml.nullcopy'); |eml.nullcopy|> function declares the size
% and type of Q without initializing it.  The expansion of the first column of A
% with <matlab:doc('repmat'); |repmat|> won't appear in code generated by
% Embedded MATLAB; it is only used to specify the size.  The |repmat| function
% was used instead of |A(:,1:m)| because A may have more rows than columns,
% which will be the case in a least-squares problem.  You have to be sure to
% always assign values to every element of an array when you declare it with
% |eml.nullcopy|, because if you don't then you will have uninitialized memory.
%
% You will notice this pattern of assignment again and again.  This is
% another key enabler of data-type independent code.
%
% The heart of this function is applying orthogonal Givens rotations
% in-place to the rows of R to zero out sub-diagonal elements, thus
% forming an upper-triangular matrix.  The same rotations are applied
% in-place to the columns of the identity matrix, thus forming
% orthogonal Q.  The Givens rotations are applied using the
% |cordicgivens| function, as defined in the next section.  The rows
% of R and columns of Q are used as both input and output to the
% |cordicgivens| function so that the computation is done in-place,
% overwriting R and Q.
%
%        [R(j,j:end),R(i,j:end),Q(:,j),Q(:,i)] = ...
%            cordicgivens(R(j,j:end),R(i,j:end),Q(:,j),Q(:,i),niter,Kn);
%
%% Defining the CORDIC Givens Rotation
% The |cordicgivens| function applies a Givens rotation by performing
% CORDIC iterations to rows |x=R(j,j:end)|, |y=R(i,j:end)| around the
% angle defined by |x(1)=R(j,j)| and |y(1)=R(i,j)| where |i>j|, thus zeroing
% out |R(i,j)|.  The same rotation is applied to columns |u = Q(:,j)| and
% |v = Q(:,i)|, thus forming the orthogonal matrix Q.
%
%    function [x,y,u,v] = cordicgivens(x,y,u,v,niter,Kn)
%      if x(1)<0
%        % Compensation for 3rd and 4th quadrants
%        x(:) = -x;  u(:) = -u;
%        y(:) = -y;  v(:) = -v;
%      end
%      for i=0:niter-1
%        x0 = x;
%        u0 = u;
%        if y(1)<0
%          % Counter-clockwise rotation
%          % x and y form R,         u and v form Q
%          x(:) = x - bitsra(y, i);  u(:) = u - bitsra(v, i);
%          y(:) = y + bitsra(x0,i);  v(:) = v + bitsra(u0,i);
%        else
%          % Clockwise rotation
%          % x and y form R,         u and v form Q
%          x(:) = x + bitsra(y, i);  u(:) = u + bitsra(v, i);
%          y(:) = y - bitsra(x0,i);  v(:) = v - bitsra(u0,i);
%        end
%      end
%      % Set y(1) to exactly zero so R will be upper triangular without roundoff
%      % showing up in the lower triangle.
%      y(1) = 0;
%      % Normalize the CORDIC gain
%      x(:) = Kn * x;  u(:) = Kn * u;
%      y(:) = Kn * y;  v(:) = Kn * v;
%    end
%
% The advantage of using CORDIC in fixed-point over the standard
% Givens rotation is that CORDIC does not use square root or divide
% operations.  Only bit-shifts, addition, and subtraction are needed
% in the main loop, and one scalar-vector multiply at the end to
% normalize the CORDIC gain. Also, CORDIC rotations work well in
% pipelined architectures.
%
% The bit shifts in each iteration are performed with the bit shift right
% arithmetic
% (<matlab:doc('bitsra'); |bitsra|>) function instead of
% <matlab:doc('bitshift'); |bitshift|>, multiplication by 0.5, or division by 2, because
% <matlab:doc('bitsra'); |bitsra|>
%
% * generates more efficient embedded code,
% * works equally well with positive and negative numbers,
% * works equally well with floating-point, fixed-point and
% integer types, and
% * keeps this code independent of data type.
%
% It is worthwhile to note that there is a difference between subscripted
% assignment (<matlab:doc('subsasgn'); |subsasgn|>) into a variable |a(:) = b|
% versus overwriting a variable |a = b|.  Subscripted assignment into a variable
% like this
%
%   x(:) = x + bitsra(y, i);
%
% always preserves the type of the left-hand-side argument |x|.  This is the
% recommended programming style in fixed-point.  For example fixed-point types
% often grow their word length in a sum, which is governed by the |SumMode|
% property of the <matlab:doc('fimath'); |fimath|> object, so that the
% right-hand-side |x + bitsra(y,i)| can have a different data type than |x|.
%
% If, instead, you overwrite the left-hand-side like this
%
%      x = x + bitsra(y, i);
%
% then the left-hand-side |x| takes on the type of the right-hand-side sum.
% This programming style leads to changing the data type of |x| in
% fixed-point code, and is discouraged.
%% Defining the Inverse CORDIC Growth Constant
% This function returns the inverse of the CORDIC growth factor after
% |niter| iterations.  It is needed because CORDIC rotations grow the
% values by a factor of approximately 1.6468, depending on the number
% of iterations, so the gain is normalized in the last step of
% |cordicgivens| by a multiplication by the inverse Kn = 1/1.6468 =
% 0.60725.
%
%    function Kn = inverse_cordic_growth_constant(niter)
%      Kn = 1/prod(sqrt(1+2.^(-2*(0:double(niter)-1))));
%    end
%
%% Exploring CORDIC Growth as a Function of Number of Iterations
% The function for CORDIC growth is defined as
%
%    growth = prod(sqrt(1+2.^(-2*(0:double(niter)-1))))
%
% and the inverse is
%
%    inverse_growth = 1 ./ growth
%
% Growth is a function of the number of iterations |niter|, and quickly
% converges to approximately 1.6468, and the inverse converges to
% approximately 0.60725.  You can see in the following table that the
% difference from one iteration to the next ceases to change after 27
% iterations.  This is because the calculation hit the limit of
% precision in double floating-point at 27 iterations.
%
%  niter       growth            diff(growth)         1./growth        diff(1./growth)

%% Comparing CORDIC to the Standard Givens Rotation
% The |cordicgivens| function is numerically equivalent to the following
% standard Givens rotation algorithm from Golub & Van Loan, _Matrix
% Computations._ In the |cordicqr| function, if you replace the call to
% |cordicgivens| with a call to |givensrotation|, then you will have the
% standard Givens QR algorithm.
%
%    function [x,y,u,v] = givensrotation(x,y,u,v)
%      a = x(1); b = y(1);
%      if b==0
%        % No rotation necessary.  c = 1; s = 0;
%        return;
%      else
%        if abs(b) > abs(a)
%          t = -a/b; s = 1/sqrt(1+t^2); c = s*t;
%        else
%          t = -b/a; c = 1/sqrt(1+t^2); s = c*t;

%      y(:) = s*x0 + c*y;  v(:) = s*u0 + c*v;
%    end
%
% The |givensrotation| function uses division and square root, which are
% expensive in fixed-point, but good for floating-point algorithms.
%
%% Example of CORDIC Rotations
% Here is a 3-by-3 example that follows the CORDIC rotations through
% each step of the algorithm.  The algorithm uses orthogonal
% rotations to zero out the subdiagonal elements of R using the
% diagonal elements as pivots.  The same rotations are applied to the
% identity matrix, thus producing orthogonal Q such that |Q*R = A|.
%
% Let A be a random 3-by-3 matrix, and initialize |R = A|, and |Q = eye(3)|.
%
%    R = A = [-0.8201    0.3573   -0.0100

%% Determining the Optimal Output Type of Q for Fixed Word Length
% Since Q is orthogonal, you know that all of its values are between -1 and +1.
% In floating-point, there is no decision about the type of Q: it should be the
% same floating-point type as A.  However, in fixed-point, you can do better
% than making Q have the identical fixed-point type as A.  For example, if A has
% word length 16 and fraction length 8, and if we make Q also have word length
% 16 and fraction length 8, then you force Q to be less accurate than it could
% be and waste the upper half of the fixed-point range.
%
% The best type for Q is to make it have full range of its possible outputs,
% plus accommodate the 1.6468 CORDIC growth factor in intermediate calculations.
% Therefore, assuming that the word length of Q is the same as the word length
% of input A, then the best fraction length for Q is 2 bits less than the word
% length (one bit for 1.6468 and one bit for the sign).
%
% Hence, our initialization of Q in |cordicqr| can be improved like
% this.
%
%   if isfi(A) && (isfixed(A) || isscaleddouble(A))
%         Q = fi(one*eye(m), get(A,'NumericType'), ...
%                'FractionLength',get(A,'WordLength')-2);
%   else
%     Q = eml.nullcopy(repmat(A(:,1),1,m));
%     Q(:) = eye(m);
%   end
%
% A slight disadvantage is that this section of code is dependent
% on data type.  However, you gain a major advantage by picking the
% optimal type for Q, and the main algorithm is still independent of data
% type.  You can do this kind of input parsing in the beginning of a function
% and leave the main algorithm data-type independent.
%
%% Preventing Overflow in Fixed Point R
% This section describes how to determine a fixed-point output type for R in
% order to prevent overflow.  In order to pick an output type, you need to
% know how much the magnitude of the values of R will grow.
%
% Given real matrix A and its QR factorization computed by Givens rotations
% without pivoting, an upper-bound on the magnitude of the elements of R is the
% square-root of the number of rows of A times the magnitude of the largest
% element in A.  Furthermore, this growth will never be greater during an
% intermediate computation. In other words, let |[m,n]=size(A)|, and
% |[Q,R]=givensqr(A)|.  Then
%
%   max(abs(R(:))) <= sqrt(m) * max(abs(A(:))).
%
% This is true because the each element of R is formed from orthogonal
% rotations from its corresponding column in A, so the largest that any element
% |R(i,j)| can get is if all of the elements of its corresponding column |A(:,j)|
% were rotated to a single value.  In other words, the largest possible value
% will be bounded by the 2-norm of |A(:,j)|.  Since the 2-norm of |A(:,j)| is equal
% to the square-root of the sum of the squares of the m elements, and each
% element is less-than-or-equal-to the largest element of A, then
%
%   norm(A(:,j)) <= sqrt(m) * max(abs(A(:))).
%
% That is, for all j
%
%   norm(A(:,j))  = sqrt(A(1,j)^2 + A(2,j)^2 + ... + A(m,j)^2)
%                <= sqrt( m * max(abs(A(:)))^2)
%                 = sqrt(m) * max(abs(A(:))).
%
% and so for all i,j
%
%   abs(R(i,j)) <= norm(A(:,j)) <= sqrt(m) * max(abs(A(:))).
%
% Hence, it is also true for the largest element of R
%
%   max(abs(R(:))) <= sqrt(m) * max(abs(A(:))).
%
% This becomes useful in fixed-point where the elements of A are often very
% close to the maximum value attainable by the data type, so we can set a tight
% upper bound without knowing the values of A.  This is important because we
% want to set an output type for R with a minimum number of bits, only knowing
% the upper bound of the data type of A.  You can use
% <matlab:doc('fi'); |fi|> method
% <matlab:doc('upperbound'); |upperbound|> to get this value.
%
% Therefore, for all i,j
%
%   abs(R(i,j)) <= sqrt(m) * upperbound(A)
%
% Note that |sqrt(m)*upperbound(A)| is also an upper bound for the elements of
% A:
%
%   abs(A(i,j)) <= upperbound(A) <= sqrt(m)*upperbound(A)
%
% Therefore, when picking fixed-point data types,
% |sqrt(m)*upperbound(A)| is an upper bound that will work for both A
% and R.
%
% Attaining the maximum is easy and common.  The maximum will occur when all
% elements get rotated into a single element, like the following
% matrix with orthogonal columns:
A = [7    -7     7     7
     7     7    -7     7
     7    -7    -7    -7
     7     7     7    -7];
%%
% Its maximum value is 7 and its number of rows is |m=4|, so we expect
% that the maximum value in R will be bounded by
% |max(abs(A(:)))*sqrt(m) = 7*sqrt(4) = 14|.  Since A in this example is
% orthogonal, each column gets rotated to the max value on the
% diagonal.
niter = 52;
[Q,R] = cordicqr(A,niter)

%%
% Another simple example of attaining maximum growth is a matrix
% that has all identical elements, like a matrix of all ones.  A
% matrix of ones will get rotated into |1*sqrt(m)| in the first row
% and zeros elsewhere.  For example, this 9-by-5 matrix will have
% all |1*sqrt(9)=3| in the first row of R.
m = 9; n = 5;
A = ones(m,n)
niter = 52;
[Q,R] = cordicqr(A,niter)
%%
% As in the |cordicqr| function, the Givens QR algorithm is often
% written by overwriting A in-place with R, so being able to cast A
% into R's data type at the beginning of the algorithm is convenient.
%
% In addition, if you compute the Givens rotations with CORDIC, there is a
% growth-factor that converges quickly to approximately 1.6468.  This growth
% factor gets normalized out after each Givens rotation, but you need to
% accommodate it in the intermediate calculations.  Therefore, the number of
% additional bits that are required including the Givens and CORDIC growth are
% <matlab:doc('log2'); |log2|>|(1.6468*|<matlab:doc('sqrt'); |sqrt|>|(m))|.  The
% additional bits of head-room can be added either by increasing the word
% length, or decreasing the fraction length.
%
% A benefit of increasing the word length is that it allows for the maximum
% possible precision for a given word length.  A disadvantage is that the
% optimal word length may not correspond to a native type on your processor
% (e.g. increasing from 16 to 18 bits), or you may have to increase to the next
% larger native word size which could be quite large (e.g. increasing from 16 to
% 32 bits, when you only needed 18).
%
% A benefit of decreasing fraction length is that you can do the computation
% in-place in the native word size of A.  A disadvantage is that you lose
% precision.
%
% Another option is to pre-scale the input by right-shifting.  This
% is equivalent to decreasing the fraction length, with the
% additional disadvantage of changing the scaling of your problem.
% However, this may be an attractive option to you if you prefer to
% only work in fractional arithmetic or integer arithmetic.

%% Example of Fixed Point Growth in R
% If you have a fixed-point input matrix A, you can define fixed-point output
% R with the growth defined in the previous section.
%
% Start with a random matrix X.
X = [0.0513   -0.2097    0.9492    0.2614
     0.8261    0.6252    0.3071   -0.9415
     1.5270    0.1832    0.1352   -0.1623
     0.4669   -1.0298    0.5152   -0.1461];
%%
% Create a fixed-point A from X.
A = sfi(X)
%%
m = size(A,1)
%%
% The growth factor is 1.6468 times the square-root of the number of rows of
% A. The bit growth is the next integer above the base-2 logarithm of the
% growth.
bit_growth = ceil(log2(cordic_growth_constant * sqrt(m)))
%%
% Initialize R with the same values as A, and a word length increased by the bit
% growth.
R = sfi(A, get(A,'WordLength')+bit_growth, get(A,'FractionLength'))
%%
% Use R as input and overwrite it.
niter = get(R,'WordLength') - 1
[Q,R] = cordicqr(R, niter)
%%
% Verify that |Q*Q'| is near the identity matrix.
double(Q)*double(Q')
%%
% Verify that Q*R - A is small relative to the precision of A.
err = double(Q)*double(R) - double(A)

%% Increasing Precision in R
% The previous section showed you how to prevent overflow in R while maintaining
% the precision of A.  If you leave the fraction length of R the same as A, then
% R cannot have more precision than A, and your precision requirements may be
% such that the precision of R must be greater.
%
% An extreme example of this is to define a matrix with an integer
% fixed-point type (i.e. fraction length is zero).  Let matrix X have
% elements that are the full range for signed 8 bit integers, between -128
% and +127.
 X = [-128  -128  -128   127
      -128   127   127  -128
       127   127   127   127
       127   127  -128  -128];
%%
% Define fixed-point A to be equivalent to an 8-bit integer.
A = sfi(X,8,0)
%%
m = size(A,1)
%%
% The necessary growth is 1.6468 times the square-root of the number of rows of
% A.
bit_growth = ceil(log2(cordic_growth_constant*sqrt(m)))
%%
% Initialize R with the same values as A, and allow for bit growth like you did
% in the previous section.
R = sfi(A, get(A,'WordLength')+bit_growth, get(A,'FractionLength'))
%%
% Compute the QR factorization, overwriting R.
niter = get(R,'WordLength') - 1;
[Q,R] = cordicqr(R, niter)
%%
% Notice that R is returned with integer values because you left the fraction
% length of R at 0, the same as the fraction length of A.
%
% The scaling of the least-significant bit (LSB) of A is 1, and you can see that
% the error is proportional to the LSB.
err = double(Q)*double(R)-double(A)
%%
% You can increase the precision in the QR factorization by increasing the
% fraction length.  In this example, you needed 10 bits for the integer part (8
% bits to start with, plus 2 bits growth), so when you increase the fraction
% length you still need to keep the 10 bits in the integer part.  For example,
% you can increase the word length to 32 and set the fraction length to 22,
% which leaves 10 bits in the integer part.
R = sfi(A, 32, 22)
%%
niter = get(R,'WordLength') - 1;
[Q,R] = cordicqr(R, niter)
%%
% Now you can see fractional parts in R, and |Q*R-A| is small.
err = double(Q)*double(R)-double(A)
%%
% The number of bits you choose for fraction length will depend on the precision
% requirements for your particular algorithm.

%% Picking Default Number of Iterations
% The number of iterations is dependent on the desired precision,
% but limited by the word length of A.  With each iteration, the
% values are right-shifted one bit.  After the last bit gets
% shifted off and the value becomes 0, then there is no additional
% value in continuing to rotate.  Hence, the most precision will be
% attained by choosing |niter| to be one less than the word
% length.
%
% For floating-point, the number of iterations is bounded by the size
% of the mantissa.  In double, 52 iterations is the most you can do to
% continue adding to something with the same exponent.  In single, it
% is 23.  See the reference page for
% <matlab:doc('eps'); eps>
% for more information about floating-point accuracy.
%
% Thus, we can make our code more usable by not requiring the
% number of iterations to be input, and assuming that we want the
% most precision possible by changing |cordicqr| to use this
% default for |niter|.
%
%   function [Q,R] = cordicqr(A,varargin)
%     if nargin>=2 && ~isempty(varargin{1})
%        niter = varargin{1};
%     elseif isa(A,'double') || isfi(A) && isdouble(A)
%       niter = 52;
%     elseif isa(A,'single') || isfi(A) && issingle(A)
%       niter = single(23);
%     elseif isfi(A)
%       niter = int32(get(A,'WordLength') - 1);
%     else
%       assert(0,'First input must be double, single, or fi.');
%     end
%
% A disadvantage of doing this is that this makes a section of our code
% dependent on data type. However, an advantage is that the function is much
% more convenient to use because you don't have to specify |niter| if you
% don't want to, and the main algorithm is still data-type independent.  Similar
% to picking an optimal output type for Q, you can do this kind of input parsing
% in the beginning of a function and leave the main algorithm data-type
% independent.
%
% Here is an example from a previous section, without needing to specify an
% optimal |niter|.
A = [7    -7     7     7
     7     7    -7     7
     7    -7    -7    -7
     7     7     7    -7];
[Q,R] = cordicqr(A)

%% Example: QR Factorization Not Unique
% When you compare the results from |cordicqr| and the QR function
% in MATLAB, you will notice that the QR factorization is not
% unique. It is only important that Q is orthogonal, R is upper
% triangular, and |Q*R - A| is small.
%
% Here is a simple example that shows the difference.
%
%
m = 3;
A = ones(m)
%%
% The built-in QR function in MATLAB uses a different algorithm and produces:
[Q0,R0] = qr(A)
%%
% And the |cordicqr| function produces:
[Q,R] = cordicqr(A)
%%
% Notice that the elements of Q from function |cordicqr| are different from Q0
% from built-in QR.  However, both results satisfy the requirement that Q is
% orthogonal:
Q0*Q0'
%%
Q*Q'
%%
% And they both satisfy the requirement that |Q*R - A| is small:
Q0*R0 - A
%%
Q*R - A

%% Solving Systems of Equations Without Forming Q
% Given matrices A and B, you can use the QR factorization to solve for X in the
% following equation:
%
%   A*X = B.
%
% If A has more rows than columns, then X will be the least-squares solution.
% If X and B have more than one column, then several solutions can be computed
% at the same time.  If |A = Q*R| is the QR factorization of A, then the solution
% can be computed by back-solving
%
%   R*X = C
%
% where |C = Q'*B|.  Instead of forming Q and multiplying to get |C = Q'*B|, it is
% more efficient to compute C directly.  You can compute C directly by applying
% the rotations to the rows of B instead of to the columns of an identity
% matrix.  The new algorithm is formed by the small modification of initializing
% |C = B|, and operating along the rows of C instead of the columns of Q.
%
%
%    function [R,C] = cordicrc(A,B,niter)
%      Kn = inverse_cordic_growth_constant(niter);
%      [m,n] = size(A);
%      R = A;
%      C = B;
%      for j=1:n
%        for i=j+1:m
%          [R(j,j:end),R(i,j:end),C(j,:),C(i,:)] = ...

% The growth in C is the same as R, so initialize C and allow for bit growth
% the same way.
C = sfi(B, get(B,'WordLength')+bit_growth, get(B,'FractionLength'))
%%
% Compute C = Q'*B directly, overwriting R and C.
[R,C] = cordicrc(R,C)
%%
% An interesting use of this algorithm is that if you initialize B to be the
% identity matrix, then output argument C is Q'.  You may want to use this
% feature to have more control over the data type of Q.  For example,
A = [-0.8201    0.3573   -0.0100
     -0.7766   -0.0096   -0.7048
     -0.7274   -0.6206   -0.8901];
B = eye(size(A,1))

%%
[R,C] = cordicrc(A,B)

%%
% Then C is orthogonal
C'*C

%%
% and |R = C*A|
R - C*A

%% Functions Used in this Demo
% These are the MATLAB functions used in this demo.
%
% *CORDICQR* computes the QR factorization using CORDIC.
%
% * |[Q,R] = cordicqr(A)| chooses the number of CORDIC iterations based
% on the type of A.
%
% * |[Q,R] = cordicqr(A,niter)| uses |niter| number of CORDIC iterations.
%
% *CORDICRC* computes R from the QR factorization of A, and also
% returns |C = Q'*B| without computing Q.
%
% * |[R,C] = cordicrc(A,B)| chooses the number of CORDIC iterations based
% on the type of A.
%
% * |[R,C] = cordicrc(A,B,niter)| uses |niter| number of CORDIC iterations.
%
% *CORDIC_GROWTH_CONSTANT* returns the CORDIC growth constant.
%
% * |cordic_growth = cordic_growth_constant(niter)| returns the CORDIC growth
% constant as a function of the number of CORDIC iterations, |niter|.
%
% *GIVENSQR* computes the QR factorization using standard Givens rotations.
%
% * |[Q,R] = givensqr(A)|, where A is M-by-N, produces an M-by-N upper triangular
%  matrix R and an M-by-M orthogonal matrix Q so that A = Q*R.
%
% *CORDICQR_MAKEPLOTS* makes the plots in this demo by executing the
% following from the MATLAB command line.
%
%   load A_3_by_3_for_cordicqr_demo.mat
%   niter=32;
%   [Q,R] = cordicqr_makeplots(A,niter)
