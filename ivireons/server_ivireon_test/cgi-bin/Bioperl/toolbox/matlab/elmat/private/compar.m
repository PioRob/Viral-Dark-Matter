%COMPAR Comparison matrices.
%   GALLERY('COMPAR',A) is DIAG(B) - TRIL(B,-1) - TRIU(B,1),
%   where B = ABS(A). GALLERY('COMPAR',A) is often denoted by M(A)
%   in the literature.
%
%   GALLERY('COMPAR',A,1) is a modified version of A with each
%   diagonal element replaced by its absolute value and each
%   off-diagonal element replaced by minus the absolute value of the
%   largest off-diagonal element in absolute value in its row.
%   However, if A is triangular, GALLERY('COMPAR',A,1) is too.
