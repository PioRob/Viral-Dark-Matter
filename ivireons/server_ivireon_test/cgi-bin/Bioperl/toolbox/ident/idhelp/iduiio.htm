The following linear difference equations are supported:
<dl>
<dt><b>ARX:</b>  <dd> A(q) y(t) = B(q) u(t-nk) + e(t)
<dt><b>ARMAX:</b> <dd>A(q) y(t) = B(q) u(t-nk) + C(q) e(t)

<dt><b>OE:</b> (Output Error)<dd>    y(t) = [B(q)/F(q)] u(t-nk) + e(t)

<dt><b>BJ:</b> (Box-Jenkins)<dd>    y(t) = [B(q)/F(q)] u(t-nk) + [C(q)/D(q)] e(t)  
</dl><p>
These are all special cases of <a href="#genio">general linear input-output models</a>. They correspond to linear difference equations relating the input to the output under various noise assumptions.<p>
<b>To estimate these models</b>, import the data. In the ident window, select Parametric Models from the Estimate pop-up menu. In the Parametric Models window, select the model structure in the Structure pop-up menu.  Specify the orders of the polynomials, enter them in the Orders field. Or, click the Order Editor button and specify the orders in the Order Editor dialog.<P>
A prediction error/maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the coefficients of the polynomials by minimizing the size of the error term, e(t), in the above expressions. Several options govern the minimization procedure. You can access these options by clicking the <a href="iduiiter.htm">Iteration Options</a> button.<p>

The algorithms are further described in the manual under ARMAX, BJ, OE,
PEM, and AUXVAR.

<title>General Input-Output Models</title>
<a name="genio">
<center><h3>General Input-Output Models</h3></center>
A general input-output linear model can be written for a single-output system with an input u and output y, as follows:<p>

A(q) y(t) = [B_i(q)/F_i(q)] u_i(t-nk_i) + [C(q)/D(q)] e(t)<p>

where u_i denotes input number i. There is an implied summation over all the inputs in the above expression.<p>

A, B_i, C, D, and F_i are polynomials in the shift operator (z or q). The general structure is defined by giving the time delays nk and the orders of the polynomials (i.e., the number of poles and zeros of the dynamic model from u to y, as well as of the noise model from e to y).<p>

Most often the choices are confined to one of the following special cases:
<br>ARX:   A(q) y(t) = B(q) u(t-nk) + e(t)

<br>ARMAX: A(q) y(t) = B(q) u(t-nk) + C(q) e(t)

<br>OE:    y(t) = [B(q)/F(q)] u(t-nk) + e(t)              (Output Error)

<br>BJ:    y(t) = [B(q)/F(q)] u(t-nk) + [C(q)/D(q)] e(t)  (Box-Jenkins)
<p>
Note that A(q) corresponds to poles that are common between the dynamic model and the noise model (useful if noise enters system "close to" the input). Likewise, F_i(q) determines the poles that are unique for the dynamics from input number i, and D(q) determines the poles that are unique for the noise.<p>
