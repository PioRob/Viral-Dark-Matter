%% Plane Take-Off with HUD Text
% 
% This model is a variant of the vrtkoff example that shows also how to display 
% signal values as text in the virtual scene and a simple Head-Up Display (HUD).
% 
% The text is sent to virtual scene using the VR Text Output block. This block formats 
% the input vector using the format string defined in its mask (see sprintf() for more information)
% and resulting string is sent to the 'string' field of the associated VRML text node in the scene.
% 
% The HUD behavior (maintaining constant relative position between the user and the 
% Text node) is achieved by defining a ProximitySensor that senses user position and 
% orientation as it navigates through the scene and routing this information to the translation
% and rotation of HUD object - in this case a VRML Transform that contains the Text node.

% the above text is taken from the "Description" property of the model
% when the property is updated, this text should be updated as well
