%% Vectorizing a Scalar Algorithm with For Each Subsystem
% The purpose of this demo is to introduce you to the usage
% of the For Each Subsystem. In this demo the operations are
% performed on vector for simplicity.

% Open the demo model <matlab:open_system('sldemo_foreach_vectorized')
% |sldemo_foreach_vectorized|>. This model contains a For Each Subsystem 
% that processes the input signals one by one.
%
% The inputs to the For Each Subsystem are: the signals to process,
% the coefficients of the FIR filter to use with each of these
% signals, and the common gain.
%
% Each signal is scalar and needs to be processed individually. Consequently,
% the For Each Block that controls the partition dimension is set to partition 
% the input signal along dimension 1, by slicing through a partition width of 1.
% For each input signal, a corresponding set of coefficients must also
% be partitioned using the same criterion. The gain is common to all the signals,
% thus this input is not partitioned.
% 
% Since the output signal dimension is expected to match the input signal 
% dimension, the concatenation dimension is set equal to the partition
% dimension. If you prefer to change the signal dimension (a 
% transpose in this case), you can choose 2 as the concatenation dimension.
%
% For the For Each Subsystem, you must set the partition dimension and width, but
% not the input signal size. A check then ensures that this size is a multiple of
% the partition width. If no error is detected, the subsystem then calculates the 
% number of independent executions that the enclosed subsystem will perform.
% These executions are independent, in that, the state associated with a given 
% contained block has a unique value in each of the respective executions.
%
% To see a non-vectorized implementation for this model, double-click 
% on the subsystem in the left corner of the model.
% This implementation does not use the For Each Subsystem. It mimics
% its functionality by replicating the subsystem as many times as necessary
% and also by selecting and concatenating the signals appropriately. This
% replication process is prone to error and is not scalable- 
% changing the input signal size would require changing the model accordingly.
