%%
% A car is running along a road with speed v(t). A sensor is installed
% at the front wheel to measure the vertical displacement Hi(t) of the 
% front wheel caused by the road profile. If the wheels and road 
% never lose contact, then the vertical displacement of the rear 
% wheel, Ho(t), can be seen as a variable transport delay of Hi(t), which 
% is determined by the length L between the two wheels and the speed v(t).

% *Figure 3:* Illustration of a fixed-length pipe.

%%
% An incompressible flow goes through a pipe of length L with speed v(t).  
% At the inlet, the flow temperature is Ti. We can model the temperature 
% at the outlet To as a variable transport delay of Ti. At time 
% t=0, the pipe is empty and  until t=2, there is no flow at the outlet. 
% Thus, the output temperature before t=2 is the initial output temperature.
