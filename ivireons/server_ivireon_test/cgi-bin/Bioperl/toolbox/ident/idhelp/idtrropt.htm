<title>Options for Transient Response</title>
<b>Additional Options submenus:<hr>
<dl>
 <dt>Step response
 <dt>Impulse response</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus choose which response to display. Note that
    impulse responses are not supported for nonlinear models.

 <dt><b>Time span</b>
    <dd>Determines the time span of the response 
    calculated/displayed.  This is as a single number which is 
the total time for the response. The time span is measured in terms of the models' time units.
The step occurs after 1/4 of the time span. "Default"
means that a suitable time span is calculated, based on the dynamics of the model. This may
be different for different models.<p>
"Other" opens a dialog where the time span can be entered. <p>
    Note that an estimated impulse response (by "correlation model") may have
    to be re-estimated for the range change to take place. 
    <dt><b>Step size</b>
    <dd>Sets the levels of the input step.   For multi-input models, the step is applied
 only to the selected input channel. The other channels are kept at the chosen starting level. <p>
This only applies to step responses. For impulse responses
    always a unit pulse is applied.

<b>Additional Style submenus:<hr>
<dl>
 <dt>Line plot
 <dt>Stem plot</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus choose the character of the plot. For impulse responses, stem plots are often a good choice.
