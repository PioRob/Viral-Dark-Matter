%% Developing The Apollo Lunar Module Digital Autopilot

% In this demonstration, one of the engineers who worked on the Apollo 
% Lunar Module digital autopilot design team describes how he would have 
% done it using Simulink(R) if it had been available in 1961.

%% Model Description
%
% Developing the autopilot in Simulink took only a fraction of the time it 
% took for the original design of the Apollo Lunar Module autopilot.  A 
% Stateflow(R) diagram in the model specifies the logic that implements the 
% phase-plane control algorithm described in the article linked below. 
% Depending on which region of the diagram the Lunar Module is executing, 
% the Stateflow diagram will be in either a Fire_region 
% or a Coast_region. Note the transitions between these different regions 
% depend on certain parameters. The Stateflow diagram determines whether 
% or not to transition to another state and then computes which reaction 
% jets to fire.

% <matlab:open_system('aero_dap3dof') Open> the |aero_dap3dof.mdl| model and run the
% simulation.

%% Project Description
%
% Building a digital autopilot was a daunting task in 1961 because
% there was very little industrial infrastructure for it - everything 
% about it was in the process of being invented.  Here is an excerpt from 
% the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/news_notes/sum99/lunar_module.html
% Summer 1999 News & Notes article>:
%
% "One reason why the [autopilot's machine code] was so complex was that the 
% number of jets that could be used to control the rotations about the 
% pilot axes was large. A decision was made to change the 
% axes that the autopilot was controlling to the "jet axes". This 
% made a dramatic change in the number of lines of code
