    <title>Using the LTI Viewer with Ident</title>
This feature is available only to users who have Control System
    Toolbox&#8482;.<p>

To activate the viewer, drag and drop the model icon to the box 'To LTI
    Viewer'. For information how to handle the viewer, type 'help
    ltiview' in the command window.<p>
    
    For models with an input, only the transfer functions from measured inputs to'
    outputs will be displayed in the viewer. For time-series models, the transfer
    functions from the noise sources to the outputs will be displayed. All models that are 
    sent to the viewer can be examined simultaneously. Plots can be clicked in and out, 
    and models can be deleted using the buttons of the viewer. <p>

Only models with the same number of inputs and outputs can be examined
      simultaneously. If a model of different size is added, the
      previous ones will be deleted from the viewer. <p>

      <b> Handling of nonlinear models:</b> When a nonlinear model, such as a 
      nonlinear ARX or a Hammerstein-Wiener model is sent to the LTI Viewer, it is automatically
      linearized using the LINAPP approximation technique. The linearized model is the best linear 
      approximation of the nonlinear model for the input signal of the Working data. <p>
          
The models are not exported to the workspace by examining them in the
      LTI-viewer. To <A HREF="idmw.htm#export">Export</a> the model drag its icon to the <b>To
	Workspace</b> box. It is then delivered as an IDMODEL or IDFRD 
      object. If desired, this can be converted to the LTI objects,
      simply by ss(m), tf(m), etc.
