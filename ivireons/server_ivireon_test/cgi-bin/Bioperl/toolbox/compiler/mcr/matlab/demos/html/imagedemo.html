%% Images and Matrices
% For any matrix X, IMAGE(X) displays a graphical image with brightness or color
% chosen from the elements of X used as indices into a colormap.  This demo
% illustrates this idea of representing a matrix as an image and in general
% displaying images stored as matrices.

%% The Simple Spiral Matrix
% SPIRAL stores a simple spiral pattern into a matrix.  You can see the spiral
% pattern of the matrix elements in the figure.  The elements of the matrix
% spiral away from the center, growing in magnitude linearly.  Small numbers
% (center values) are mapped to black and dark gray, while the larger values
% (around the edge of the matrix) are mapped to light gray and white.  The
% assignment of small values of the matrix to black, large values of the
% matrix to white and intermediate values to shades of gray determines a
% color map.

colormap(gray);
X = spiral(8); 
image(X);

%% Colormaps
% COLORMAP function is used to change the color mapping.  The map had been set
% with colormap(gray) in the previous screen.  Here we change the colormap to
% hue-saturation-value (hsv) color map.  The colors begin with red, pass through
% yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and return to red.

colormap(hsv);

%%
% Another color map is 'hot'. The 'hot' colormap ranges from black through
% shades of red and yellow to white.

colormap(hot);

%%
% The quantities 'hsv' and 'hot' used with the COLORMAP function are, of course,
% matrices.  (More precisely, they are the names of functions which return
% matrices.)  Color map matrices have three columns which specify intensities of
% the red, green and blue video components.  The number of rows depends upon the
% particular image.  In this example, the elements of X = spiral(8) range from 1
% to 64, so we are using 64 rows.

M = hot;
size(M)

%%
% The elements of X are used as indices into the color map and so X must have
% positive, integer elements between 1 and the length of the map.  To see how an
% individual color is determined, pick one element of X, say X(7,1).  The
% corresponding color map entry is M(37,:).  This has full intensity in the red
% gun, a little over half intensity in the green gun, and no blue.  It produces
% the shade of orange in the cell in the (7,1) position near the lower left
% corner.

ColorMapIndex = X(7,1)
M(ColorMapIndex,:)

%%
% In general, the statements
%
% image(X), colormap(M);
%
% produce a display of colored cells where the RGB intensity of the (i,j)-th
% cell is the 3-vector M(X(i,j),:).  The matrix X can be of any size, but its
% elements must be positive integers between 1 and m.  The matrix M should then
% have m rows, 3 columns, and elements between 0.0 and 1.0.  COLORMAP(M) also
% sets the colors used by PCOLOR(X), SURF(Z) and MESH(Z), but in these cases the
% data matrix, X or Z, is rescaled to provide indices into the color map.  A
% completely different feature of our spiral example is revealed by the 'flag'
% color map.  The 'flag' colormap is simply m/4 copies of the matrix
% flag(4), shown below, stacked on top of each other.  The colors red, white,
% blue and black are used cyclically as the elements of X vary and so finer
% details of the image data become apparent.  In this example, we can see the
% diagonal patterns in the matrix

colormap(flag);  
flag(4)

%%
% Since color maps are matrices, it is possible to modify them, or create new
% ones, with MATLAB(R) array operations.  For example the hot color map can be
% softened by adding some gray.

S = (hot + gray)/2;
colormap(S)

%%
% A 'hot' colormap, softened by 'gray', can be brightened by raising the
% elements of the color map to a power less than 1.

X = spiral(8); 
image(X);
gamma = .6;
S = (hot + gray)/2;
S = S.^gamma;
colormap(S)

%%
% The command RGBPLOT, produces a plot of the color map.  The x-axis is the map
% index, which corresponds to the elements of X in IMAGE(X), and the y-axis is
% the intensity of the red, green and blue components.

rgbplot(S)

%% Using SPY
% A sparse matrix display function, SPY, is useful for displaying the location
% of image elements which point to a particular color map entry.  The following
% code segment loads a file containing altitude data for eastern New England and
% displays all the elements which use the second or third element of the color
% map.  Locations with X==1 correspond to sea level, so we see a crude
% representation of the coast line.

load cape
spy((X==2) | (X==3))

%% Examples of Large Images
% Our 8-by-8 spiral matrix is only a small, illustrative example.  Larger
% matrices resulting from extensive computations, or images obtained from
% photographs, satellites, or scanners are more typical.  The demos directory
% contains several sample images with their own color maps and the color
% directory contains M-files which generate other useful color maps.  Below, you
% see a listing of MAT files that have these images and their corresponding
% colormaps.  You can choose to use any of these images (from the structure
% imglist), and select any of the color maps listed under colorlabels (including
% the default colormap 'map' that is loaded with the image).  To do this, you
% will have to select the following code and execute it.  Make changes to
% different parameters and see the changes.
