<center><h3>Range and Grid Point Values for Nonlinear Plots</h3></center>

<p><b>Nonlinear ARX Model Plot</b>: This dialog allows setting
of number of samples for regressors. Enter a positive integer for number of
samples. This setting controls the gridding of the regressor space along each
axis. For example, if number of samples is set to 20, each regressor input will
contain 20 points within its specified range. For 3-Dimensionl plots, this amounts
to evaluating the nonlinearity in a space of 20x20 = 400 points.</p>

<p><b>Hammerstein-Wiener Plot</b>: This dialog allows setting
of a range for input (x-axis). Enter range of values for the input to the currently
displayed nonlinearity block. Range should be entered as a 2-element array of [min
max] values. The nonlinearity is plotted in the range of specified values.</p>
