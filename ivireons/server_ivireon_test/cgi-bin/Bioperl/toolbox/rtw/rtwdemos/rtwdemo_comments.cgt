%% Abstract:
%%   This is the example Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder source code
%%   template.  With this template you are able to highly customize and
%%   manipulate the appearance of the generated code.  The template is
%%   ideally suited for adding company information, including version
%%   control tokens, adjusting the code's appearance, and so on.
%%
%%   There is a list of optional tokens that can be used to comment the
%%   generated code.  These tokens can be used inside comment statements
%%   anywhere throughout the template:
%%
%%   %<FileName>, %<FileType>, %<FileTag>, %<ModelName>, %<ModelVersion>,
%%   %<RTWFileVersion>, %<RTWFileGeneratedOn>, %<TLCVersion>, and
%%   %<SourceGeneratedOn>
%%
%%   The code insertion section is required. There is a list of required 
%%   tokens that represent the components of the generated code.  You 
%%   can manipulate this list, for example to insert other code or 
%%   comments; it's only required that you do not remove or reorder them.
%%   The list of expected tokens, each of which must appear on a line 
%%   by itself, is listed below:
%%
%%   %<Includes>
%%   %<Defines>
%%   %<Types>
%%   %<Enums>
%%   %<Definitions>
%%   %<Declarations>
%%   %<Functions>
%%
%%   Tokens in this file are automatically translated to appropriate TLC
%%   syntax as part of the normal Real-Time Workshop build process.  To
%%   escape a token, that is to prepare it for normal TLC expansion, use
%%   the '!' character.  For example, the token %<!TokenName> is expanded
%%   to %<TokenName> by the template conversion program.  Any valid TLC
%%   code can be specified, including TLC function calls: %<!MyTLCFcn()>.
%%
%%   For more customization options, particularly for placing and formatting
%%   Simulink data objects, see the Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder User's
%%   Guide.
