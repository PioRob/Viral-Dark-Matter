%END Terminate scope of FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, TRY, and IF statements.
%   Without END's, FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, TRY, and IF wait for further input.
%   Each END is paired with the closest previous unpaired FOR, WHILE,
%   SWITCH, TRY or IF and serves to terminate its scope.
%
%   END also marks the termination of an M-file function, although in 
%   most cases it is optional. END statements are required only in 
%   M-files that employ one or more nested functions. Within such an 
%   M-file, every function (including primary, nested, private, and 
%   subfunctions) must be terminated with an END statement. You can 
%   terminate any function type with END, but doing so is not required
%   unless the M-file contains a nested function.
%
%   END can also serve as the last index in an indexing expression.  In
%   that context, END = SIZE(X,k) when used as part of the k-th index.
%   Examples of this use are, X(3:end) and X(1,1:2:end-1).  When using END
%   to grow an array, as in X(end+1) = 5, make sure X exists first.
%
%   END(A,K,N) is called for indexing expressions involving the object A
%   when END is part of the K-th index out of N indices.  For example,
%   the expression A(end-1,:) calls A's END method with END(A,1,2).
%
%   See also FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, TRY, IF.
