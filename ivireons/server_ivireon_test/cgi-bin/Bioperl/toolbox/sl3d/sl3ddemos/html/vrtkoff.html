%% Plane Take-Off
% 
% The vrtkoff example represents a simplified aircraft taking-off from a runway. There are
% several viewpoints defined in this model, both static and attached to the plane, allowing
% you to see the take-off from various perspectives.
% 
% The model demonstrates the technique of combining several objects imported or 
% obtained from different sources (CAD packages, general 3-D modelers etc.) into a virtual
% reality scene. Usually it is necessary for you to wrap such imported objects by an
% additional VRML Transform node. This wrapper allows you to set appropriately the
% scaling, position, and orientation of the objects to fit in the scene. In this example, the
% aircraft model from the V-Realm Builder Object Library was incorporated into the scene.
% 
% We prepared a slightly different object for you with same scene in the file vrtkoff2.wrl. 
% You can try to associate this file from the VR Sink block dialog box to see the difference.
