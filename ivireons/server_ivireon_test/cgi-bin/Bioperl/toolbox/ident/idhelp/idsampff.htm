<title>Setting the Time or Frequency Span for Model Fit</title>

<center><h3>Dialog for Setting Data Span for Model Output Plot</h3></center><p>

This dialog is opened by clicking on the "Set data span for fit..." menu option under "Options" file menu of the 
Model Output plot. Use this dialog to set the data span to use for creating the plot and viewing the 
corresponding fit percentage. <p>

If validation data is <b>time domain data</b>: Enter the lower and upper limits for the time span 
(in actual time units) for which the fit between measured and predicted/simulated outputs is to be calculated. <p>

If validation data is <b>frequency domain data</b>: Enter the lower and upper limits for the frequency span 
(in actual frequency units used for the data) for which the fit between measured and simulated 
outputs is to be calculated. <p>

The default uses all samples in the Validation Data set, which can also be obtained by entering the empty matrix.<p>

In time domain signals, it is sometimes useful to exclude the transient from the comparison. 
For frequency domain data, excluding higher frequency values (which generally contain noisy response) 
can lead to good fit values. <p>

When the validation data is changed, the default choice of data span is automatically restored.
