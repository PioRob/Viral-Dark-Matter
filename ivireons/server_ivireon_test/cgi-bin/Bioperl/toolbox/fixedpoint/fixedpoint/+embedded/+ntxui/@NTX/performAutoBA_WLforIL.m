%      included in the word; this is because the threshold line goes "to
%      the left" of the bin, and the histogram bin is (a,b] which
%      is open on the left.
% ntx.LastOver accounted for the extra MSB bits specified - negate the
% guard bits from ntx.LastOver. We've already accounted for the signBit in
% the initial calculation of FL. Since ntx.LastOver includes the sign bit,
% remove it from the msb calculation too.
