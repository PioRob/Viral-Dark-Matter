<center><h3>Specifying Coefficients of One-dimensional Polynomial Nonlinearity Estimator</h3></center>

<p>This dialog for specifying coefficients of one-dimensional polynomial nonlinearity 
estimator (poly1d) is launched by pressing the Initial value ... button in the fourth column of the
table in the Hammerstein-Wiener model's I/O Nonlinearity panel in the Nonlinear Models 
window. Note that it is not necessary to specify the initial values, since they can be determined
automatically by the estimation algorithm during the estimation process.
</p>

<p>
<b>How to specify:</b> The dialog offers a single edit box to enter the coefficients 
of the polynomial. The default is an empty matrix (<tt>[]</tt>), which means that the 
coefficient values will be determined during estimation by inspecting the model structure and 
the estimation data. If not empty, the coefficients must be specified as a row vector
of length <tt>N+1</tt> where N is the degree (order) of the polynomial. The chosen degree is 
indicated on the topmost line in this dialog. To change the degree, modify the value in the 
third column of the I/O Nonlinearity table ("No. of Units"). The coefficient vector must be 
real and finite. The specified variable or expression will be evaluated in the MATLAB base 
workspace.
</p>


<p> 
    After entering an expression of variable for the Coefficients in the edit box, hit the 
    Apply or OK button to initialize the nonlinearity with those coefficient values. Hit
    Cancel to close the dialog.
