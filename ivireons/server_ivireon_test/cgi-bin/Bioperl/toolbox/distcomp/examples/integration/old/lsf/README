RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
========================================================

To run jobs when a shared file system is present between client and the 
cluster machines, the following files are used:

* lsfSimpleSubmitFcn.m
* lsfSimpleDecodeFcn.m
* lsfJobArraySubmitFcn.m
* lsfJobArrayDecodeFcn.m 
* lsfParallelSubmitFcn.m
* lsfParallelDecode.m
* lsfParallelWrapper.sh




RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER DO NOT SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
===============================================================

To run jobs in the absence of a shared file system between client and 
cluster machines, use the files in the subdirectory "nonshared".
