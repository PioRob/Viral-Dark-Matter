%% Counters Using Conditionally Executed Subsystems
% 
% This demonstration uses counter circuits to contrast the execution of blocks in enabled 
% subsystems and triggered subsystems for the same control signal. After running the 
% simulation, the scope shows three plots. 
% 
% The first of these plots shows the control signal which is the output of the discrete 
% pulse generator. 
% 
% The second plot shows the output of the counter circuit in the enabled subsystem. 
% The counter increments while the subsystem is enabled and then holds its output when 
% the subsystem is disabled. The counter resets to zero when the subsystem is re-enabled 
% because the enable port was configured to reset states when enabling. 
% 
% The third plot shows the output of the counter circuit in the triggered subsystem. The 
% counter increments every rising edge of the control signal. 
% 
% The signals are shown in a Signal Viewer scope that does not require a scope block to
% be put into the block diagram.  Instead, the "glasses" icon notation on the ports show 
% that a Signal Viewer is attached.  Double click on the glasses to make the Signal 
% Viewer appear if it is hidden.
