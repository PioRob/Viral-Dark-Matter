<center><h3>Special Options for Nonlinear ARX Model Plots</h3></center>

<p>There is a collapsible "control panel" on the right side of
the plot axes, which contains several options for configuring the contents of
the Nonlinear ARX model plot. The shown plot is the value of nonlinearity
as a function of one or two selected regressors. </p>

<p>User "Regressors 1" popup menu to select the regressor
variable for the X axis of the plot. Use the Range edit box to assign a range
of values to this axis.</p>

<p>User "Regressors 2" popup menu to select the regressor
variable for the Y axis of the plot. Use the Range edit box to assign a range
of values to this axis. Set the Regressor 2 popup selection to "&lt;none&gt;"
(which is the first option in the popup list) to generate a 2-dimensional plot, that
is, a plot of the nonlinearity as a function of the regressor selected in the
"Regressor 1" popup menu only.</p>

<p>Fixed values must be assigned to the regressors not selected
in either of the two popup menus. To do this, press the "Fix Values ..."
button. This launches a table listing all the regressors that are not selected
for either X or Y axes of the plot. The second column of the table contains
constant values for these regressors. Set a finite double scalar as a value for
any regressor in this table. Click OK button to accept the changes.</p>

<p>Press Apply button after any changes made in the control
panel to update the plot.</p>
