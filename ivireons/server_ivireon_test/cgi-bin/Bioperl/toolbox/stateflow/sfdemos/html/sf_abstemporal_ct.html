% The model consists of a single Stateflow chart with two states |A| and
% |B|. The transition is guarded by the expression |after(4.2345,sec)|.

%% 
% Please note the following:
% 
% # The chart has the "Update Method" set to "continuous" and the option
% "Enable zero-crossing detection" checked.
% # We are using a variable step solver with zero crossings enabled.
% 
% When we simulate the model, we see the following output:

evalc('sim(model)');
open_system([model '/Scope']);

%%
% If we plot the simulation time-step with respect to the simulation time,
% we see the following:

plot(tout, [diff(tout); NaN]);
xlabel('Simulation time (t)');
ylabel('Simulation time step (dt = diff(t))');

%% 
% As is evident, the solver very accurately finds the time at which the
% transition from |A| to |B| happened.
