<title>Estimating Models</title>
<center><h3>Estimating Models</h3></center><p>
<b>Estimate</b> pop-up menu in the ident window provides methods for estimating models 
based on the <i>Working Data</i> set. The models are inserted into the rectangular placeholders
in the <a href="idmw.htm#datamod">Model Board</a>, located in the ident window.<p>
The pop-up has the following commands:
<dl>
<dt><a href="idparest.htm"><b>Linear parametric models</b></a>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to generate dynamic linear models with
different structures, orders, and delays. 
A model structure characterizes the relationship between the input and output data,
and between unknown noise sources and the output data. Supported model structures 
include ARX, ARMAX, Output Error (OE), Box-Jenkins (BJ), State-Space, and others.
<dt><a href="idprocest.htm"><b>Process models</b></a>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to generate simple, continuous-time, dynamic linear models - 
characterized by static gain, time constants, and time delays
 
<dt><a href="nlmodelestim.htm"><b>Nonlinear models</b></a>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to generate nonlinear dynamic models of two types: 
Nonlinear ARX models and Hammerstein-Wiener models. 

<dt><a href="spa.htm"><b>Spectral model</b></a>
<dd>Estimates the system's frequency response from the data by using either 
Fourier Transform techniques or the Blackman-Tukey approach
<dt><a href="cra.htm"><b>Correlation model</b></a>
<dd>Estimates the system's transient response (impulse response) 
by correlating filtered versions of the input-output data 
<dt><b>Quick start</b>
<dd>Performs correlation analysis and spectral analysis. 
Computes a default ARX model with a delay that is determined heuristically based on the 
estimated impulse response of the system, as well as a default order state-space model.
