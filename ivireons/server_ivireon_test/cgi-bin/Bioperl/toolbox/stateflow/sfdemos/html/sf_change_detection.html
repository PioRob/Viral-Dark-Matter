% since the last time step. This demonstration gives a basic overview of this feature. Three new functions are provided for querying the
% change: hasChanged, hasChangedFrom and hasChangedTo which return 1 or 0 based on whether there was a change. 
% Note that these are functional form keywords and can be used wherever normal function call is made.

% the value of y is being set in four states which are connected by transition action with hasChanged* condition actions. Try to follow the transition
% path by comparing to scope output.
