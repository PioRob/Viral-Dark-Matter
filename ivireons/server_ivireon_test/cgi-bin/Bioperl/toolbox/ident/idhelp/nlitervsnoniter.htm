<center><h3>Iterative vs Non-iterative Estimation Schemes For Nonlinear Models</h3></center>

<p>Estimation of nonlinear models may use a constructive (non-iterative) 
   or an iterative scheme. Constructive schemes are special (efficient) algorithms 
   designed for specific nonlinearity estimators. When available, they make the estimation 
   process faster and less sensitive to initial conditions. Iterative schemes employ 
   nonlinear least squares (line search or trust region based optimization) to minimize the 
   cost function associated with the estimation. For many nonlinearity estimators, iterative 
   methods are the only options available. The various choices for iterative estimation schemes are 
   available as “Search Methods” under Algorithm options. Type "idprops idnlestimators" in MATLAB Command 
   Window for more information.</p>

<p>All Hammerstein-Wiener model estimations are iterative in nature, regardless of the 
   choice of nonlinearities.</p>

<p>Nonlinear ARX model estimations may be iterative or not depending upon the
choice of nonlinearity and estimation focus.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Tree Partition: If Tree Partition is chosen as the type of nonlinearity, 
     estimation is always non-iterative. Focus must be Prediction when using 
     this nonlinearity.</li>
 <li>Wavelet Network: By default,
     a first estimation (no initial model) is non-iterative. When using an <a
     href="nlinitialmodeldlg.htm">initial model</a> (initializing estimation using 
     an existing model by pressing on the "Initialize..." button), the
     estimation becomes iterative. To force the first estimation to be
     iterative, set the Iterative_Wavenet algorithm option to “on”. </li>
 <li>Neural Network: Estimation of
     a Nonlinear ARX model with a Neural Network object is iterative in nature.
     However, the iteration information is not displayed in the Estimation Trace.
     Instead, a figure is launched that shows the progress of estimation. For
     more information on training of neural networks, refer to help on Neural
     Network Toolbox&#8482;. </li>
 <li>All other nonlinearity
     choices (Sigmoid Network, Custom Network) lead to an iterative estimation.
     </li>
 <li>If Focus in algorithm options
     is set to Simulation, the estimation becomes iterative. Setting Focus to
     Simulation is not allowed if nonlinearity is Tree Partition, Neural
     Network. </li>
</ul>
