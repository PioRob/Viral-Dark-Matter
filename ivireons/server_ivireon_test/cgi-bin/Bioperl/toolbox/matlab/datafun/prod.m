%PROD Product of elements.
%   For vectors, PROD(X) is the product of the elements of X. For
%   matrices, PROD(X) is a row vector with the product over each
%   column. For N-D arrays, PROD(X) operates on the first
%   non-singleton dimension.
%
%   PROD(X,DIM) works along the dimension DIM. 
%
%   Example: If X = [0 1 2
%                    3 4 5]
%
%   then prod(X,1) is [0 4 10] and prod(X,2) is [ 0
%                                                60]
