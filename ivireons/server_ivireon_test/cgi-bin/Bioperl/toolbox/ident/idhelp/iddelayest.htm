<center><h3>Determining Input Delay Graphically</h3></center>

<p>The dialog for determining input delay graphically is
launched by clicking on the Infer input delay... button on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regressors panel for Nonlinear ARX models under "Configure" panel of
Nonlinear Models window.</li>

<li>Input block for Hammerstein-Wiener models under "Configure" panel of
Nonlinear Models window.</li>

</ul>

<p>This dialog, titled Infer Input Delay offers time response
and impulse response plots to gain insight into the input delay present in the
measured data set. the response plots are generated for a selected input-output
pair. Note that determining input delay from measured data is a difficult
problem. The suggested delay, as shown in these plots, need not necessarily be
the true delay present in the physical system under observation. For MIMO
systems, it may not be meaningful to determine delays independently for each
I/O pair.</p>

<p>The top panel in the Infer Input Delay dialog contains popup
menus for selecting an input and an output. For the selected pair, the time
plot and the impulse response plots are shown in two tabbed panels beneath.
Each plot contains marker lines to assist in identifying (and marking) the
locations relevant for delay determination. The corresponding delay value is
printed below the plots. </p>

<p>Click on Insert button to accept the shown delay value for
the currently selected I/O pair. Clicking on this button has the following
effect:</p>

<ul>
 <li>In Regressors panel for Nonlinear ARX models, the table
     cell in the second column ("delay") corresponding to the selected input
     channel is updated.</li>
 <li>In Input block for Hammerstein-Wiener models, the value of
     input delay (nk) in fourth column is updated for the selected input
     channel.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Time Plot</b>:
The input and the output measurements are superposed on this
plot. The input delay is the time interval between the time the input becomes
non-zero to the time the output becomes non-zero. This is useful if the
measurements pertain to an experiment that starts from a state of rest. This can
thus be useful for transient experiments. In multi-input cases, if the inputs
are coupled, it may be difficult to isolate the delay from an individual input
channel to an output channel.</p>

<p>Two red marker lines are provided for marking the time
instants when the input and the output become non-zero. Place the left red line 
at a time point where the input (black) makes a significant change. Move the 
other red line to the point where you see the first trace of a response in the 
output (blue) to this change.The interval between the two red lines (in actual time 
as well as number of samples) is shown in a text area beneath the plot. Click on 
Insert button to accept the shown value.</p>

<p><b>Impulse Response</b>:
This plot shows the component of the impulse response from
the selected input to the selected output. A 1 s.d. confidence interval
(denoting statistically zero response) is also shown as a yellow-colored patch.
The delay is indicated by the positive time corresponding to the first response
value that is outside this confidence interval. Information about delay may be
obscured by presence of feedback in the measured data.</p>

<p>The origin (time=0) is marked by a dotted black line. In
addition, a red-colored marker line is provided to mark the first significant
impulse response value. The input delay, as indicated by the location of this
red marker line, is shown in a text area beneath the plot. Click on Insert
button to accept the shown value.</p>

Structure Selection: Determining Model Order and Input Delay” (iddemo3) for
more information on how to determine input delay.</p>
