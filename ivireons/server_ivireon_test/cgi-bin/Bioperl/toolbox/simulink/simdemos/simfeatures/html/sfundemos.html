%% Custom Code and Hand Coded Blocks using the S-function API
% 
% This library launches examples of different types of Simulink(R) S-functions. Simulink 
% S-functions allow you to extend Simulink with new hand coded blocks, interface 
% to custom external code, and create live interfaces to other programs. Models 
% containing S-functions in the following programming languages can be accessed
%  through this demonstration: C, C++, M and Fortran.
% 
% Each example contains a model that exercises an S-function block and a link for 
% editing the S-function code. You can also access the main S-function file by 
% using the Edit... button on the S-function block dialog (which is under a mask in 
% some of the models; use the "Look Under Mask" context menu item to access the 
% S-function dialog in this situation). 
% 
% Additionally, the S-function Builder block is a masked version of the S-function 
% block that includes an easy to use editor that automatically builds an S-function 
% out of a core algorithm that you enter into it along with input, output, and parameter 
% attributes. By default, the S-function Builder also creates a TLC file for use with 
% Real-Time Workshop(R) and Real-Time Workshop(R) Embedded Coder(TM).
