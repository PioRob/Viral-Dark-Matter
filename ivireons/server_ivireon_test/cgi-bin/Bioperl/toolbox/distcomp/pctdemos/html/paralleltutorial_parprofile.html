%% Using the Parallel Profiler in Pmode
% This demo provides a brief introduction to using the parallel profiler.
% It is intended to be a quickstart guide to using the parallel profiler
% graphical user interface (GUI) and its basic commands. Links are provided
% to the other parallel profiler demos. Start with this demo unless you are
% already familiar with |mpiprofile|.

%   Copyright 2007-2010 The MathWorks, Inc.

%%
% *Prerequisites*:
% 
% * Interactive Parallel Mode in the Parallel Computing Toolbox(TM) (See
% |pmode| in the user's guide.)
% * A configured cluster if you wish to use more labs than allowed under
% the local scheduler
% * Familiarity with the standard profiler (See documentation for
% |profile|.)

%%
% You should have at least a few labs when trying the
% parallel profiler and the following demos. You need at least three to
% four labs to see the difference between good and bad example parallel
% code. It is also preferable if all labs are of the same speed and
% capability.

%% Introduction
%
% Throughout this demo, which acts as a tutorial on the basics of the
% parallel profiler, we assume you are familiar with basic features of the
% standard |profile| command.
% If you are new to MATLAB(R), familiarize
% yourself with the examples in the |profile| help before trying the
% parallel version (|mpiprofile|) in this demo. 
%
% The MATLAB code related to |mpiprofile| should not be
% executed in a regular MATLAB session, but rather at the |P>>| prompt in
% the Parallel Command Window.  See the Parallel Computing Toolbox Users
% Guide for details on |pmode|. 

%% Enabling the Parallel Profiler
% Before profiling your parallel
% code, turn on the parallel profiler's data collection using |mpiprofile|.
% Similar to the standard profiler, |mpiprofile on| can be use to enabled
% the parallel profiler.
mpiprofile on;

%%
% A profiling session usually starts with a |mpiprofile on| and ends with
% |mpiprofile viewer| or |mpiprofile off|. When we mention a
% profiling session we refer to the data collected between the start
% and end of the parallel profiler.
%
% The current status of the parallel profiler can be confirmed
% by executing:
mpiprofile status;

%%
% You can then execute any function as you do with the standard |profile|
% command. For instance, you can view the raw profiling information using
% |mpiprofile info|.
A = rand(1024, codistributor());
B = A*A;
mpiprofile info;

%% Starting the Graphical Viewer
% Once you have completed running your code with the profiler, you can view
% the results using the graphical interface by typing : 
mpiprofile viewer; % This also turns off the profiler.

%%
% Each of the MATLAB workers running in your cluster collects the profiling
% data and automatically transfers it to the client(when in |pmode|). 
% If you want to use all the features of the graphical browser, the
% profiled MATLAB files need to be available on the client.

%%
% Once the viewer starts three types of pages or _views_ are available.

%% Function Summary Report
% The parallel profile viewer, opens with the Function Summary Report
% first, in the same way as the standard profiler. In this view you can see
% profile information from any single lab or from multiple labs
% simultaneously. It initially shows all functions executed on lab 1. You
% can then choose via the listbox options to see profiling information from
% any lab.
% 
% In this view you can see Aggregate information using the *Manual
% Comparison Selection* listboxes. When you select an Aggregate in this
% view, the profiler accumulates and displays the specified data about all
% of the executed functions. For example, 
%
% * *max Time Aggregate* lists every function called in
% the program, and for each function, the data from the lab that spent the
% most time executing it. 
% * *min Time >0 Aggregate* lists every function called in
% the program, and for each function, the statistics from the lab that
% spent the least time executing it.

%%
% <<paralleltutorial_prof_menuagg2.png>>

%%
% Here are a few things to keep in mind in this view:
%
% * To re-sort the table by a different field simply click the related
% column title (e.g. *Total Comm Time*).
% * To select a function and go to the Function Detail Report, click any
% function name that appears in the *Function Name* column.
% * To compare profiling information from different labs, use the
% *Comparison* listboxes and buttons (found in the top of each page).
% Comparison information always displays in a maroon color font. The other
% demos (see the links at the top of this demo) provide examples of how to
% use comparisons to pinpoint problems. 
% * To find which lab the main
% profiling data (black or blue text) comes from, look at the orange
% highlighted text at the top of the displayed page or in the top toolbar.

%% Function Detail Report
% The Function Detail Report displays information on the individual lines
% executed inside the current function for each lab. This includes a 
% *Busy Lines* table which can be used to compare the top five lines of
% code on different labs. This report is only fully functional if the 
% profiled MATLAB files are available on the client MATLAB path.
%
% The Function Detail Report is different from the
% Function Summary Report in several ways:
%
% * The report is generated for one function at a time. The function name
% is displayed at the top of the page, in green or orange. Green
% highlighting indicates that the function spent very little (or no) time
% in communication. Orange highlighting indicates more than 20% of the time
% was spent in communication or waiting for communication. 
% * Every listbox option takes into account the last function you clicked.
% The current function can be changed, if need be, by clicking the *Home*
% button in the top toolbar, which also takes you back to the Function
% Summary Report.
% * Profile information Aggregates from multiple labs are calculated
% only on a _per function_ basis. Therefore in the Function Detail Report,
% selecting *max Time Aggregate* displays
% information from the one lab that took longest executing the current
% function. 
% * Comparisons of profiling information are only available in the top five
% lines shown in the *Busy Lines* table (the first table from the top
% unless there is a parents table). 


%% Plot View Report
% The *Plot View* is shown whenever you click a plot option in the *Show
% Figures* listbox. The plots show communication and timing information
% from all the labs for the given function. There are two types of plots
% (Histograms and PerLab Images). The *Plot Time Histograms* and *Plot All
% PerLab Communication* options show three figures using the corresponding
% communication fields returned by the |mpiprofile info| command. 
%
% * *Plot Time Histograms* shows histograms for Total Time, Total
% Communication Time, and  Communication Waiting Time. 
%
% * *Plot All PerLab Communication* shows 2D color coded image plots for
%  Data Received, Receive Communication Time, and Communication Waiting
% Time.
%
% * The *Plot CommTimePerLab* option in the *Show Figures* listbox shows
% only the *Receive Communication Time* chart and therefore is faster to
% generate. 
%
% *Plotting Per Function or Per Session*
%
% There are two modes for the plots:
%
% * _Overall session_ plots:  If you are in the Function Summary Report
% _and_ you have not selected any function the plots are generated for all
% code executed (with the profiler on).
% * _Per function_ plots : If you are in the Function Detail Report after
% having selected a function, clicking any of the available plots
%  (in the listbox shown below) will take you to the function specific
%  *Plot View*.
%
% You can always tell which plot mode you are using by looking at the
% titles of each figure. The titles show the name of the current
% function (or _all functions_ when showing data for the entire session).
% The titles also include the name of the profiling field being displayed 
%  (e.g., Communication Time, Total Time). 
% If you want to see the data for the entire profiling session after having
% selected a specific function, click *Home* to go back to the Function
% Summary Report then select your desired plot (using the listbox shown
% below).
