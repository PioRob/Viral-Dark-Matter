 <dt>Periodogram

    <dd>These mutually exclusive options specify how to compute the spectra. 
    A periodogram is computed as the absolute square of the Fourier transform, 
    divided by the number of data points and multiplied by the sampling interval.
    The method and resolution parameters are set in the Spectral Model dialog, which you open
 by selecting <b>Estimate->Spectral model</b> from the pop-up meu in the ident window. 
     Only scalar resolution parameters are accepted for the SPAFDR
    case. You set the frequency range in the Set Frequency Range dialog, opened by selecting
    <b>Options->Frequency range</b> in the plot window.<p>

 <dt><b>Frequency range</b>
    <dd>Opens a dialog for customizing the frequency range.  
    The default choice is 128 linearly-spaced values up to the Nyquist frequency.
