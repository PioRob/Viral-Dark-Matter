%% About This Demo 
% Open the demo model <matlab:open_system('sldemo_varsize_channel_pow_alloc')
% |sldemo_varsize_channel_pow_alloc|>. This model implements the waterfilling 
% algorithm for obtaining the optimal power allocation for communication channels
% when a power budget exists. The communication channels involved are independent
% (i.e., parallel channels) and have different noise levels.
%
% The algorithm iteratively increases the value of the waterline, so that the 
% channels which have a noise level less than the waterline are broadcast. The power used 
% by these transmitting channels is equal to the difference between the waterline
% and the noise level of the channel. The sum of the power used by all the channels
% transmitting should satisfy the power budget within the specified tolerance.
%
% The Find block is used in the calculation of the total power used for a certain
% waterline value. The channels which are set to transmit at that waterline level 
% are selected using logical indexing. The logical indices are obtained after 
% thresholding the difference of the waterline and the channel noise levels. As a result, 
% the channels with noise levels larger than the waterline are assigned a zero, and 
% those with noise levels below the waterline are assigned ones. The Find block is
% used for converting the logical indices into linear indices. Note that this signal 
% is properly modeled by a variable-size signal since the number of channels below the
% threshold is unknown at compile time. The linear indices are fed into a Selector
% block that picks the channel transmission powers. Subsequently, these powers are summed to get the current 
% value of used power. If this value is smaller than the power budget, the waterline is
% increased and the process is repeated until the used power equals the power constraint.
