%% WHILE Loops
%
% With the use of flow charts, Stateflow(R) allows you to create C-Code or
% M-Code statements such as the WHILE loop. This particular demo illustrates
% how a WHILE loop and a DO-WHILE can be implemented in Stateflow in order to
% create a variable array. The equivalent statements in C-Code are as
% follows:
% 
% WHILE: while(condition < 20) { while_output[i] = condition; i++; condition
% += 2; }
% 
% DO - WHILE: do { do_output[i] = condition; condition += 2; i++; }
% while(condition < 20);
% 
% The variable WHILE_OUTPUT is an array with 10 elements and the variable
% DO_OUTPUT is 11 elements. Notice that in the scope block, the DO-WHILE loop
% has an extra value of 20 which is what is expected.
% 
% You can use such loops to update or buffer a multi-dimensional variable
% from within Stateflow.
