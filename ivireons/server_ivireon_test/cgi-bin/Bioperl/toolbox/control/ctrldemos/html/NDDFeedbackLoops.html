%% Using FEEDBACK to Close Feedback Loops
% This demo shows why you should always use FEEDBACK to close feedback
% loops.

%% Two Ways of Closing Feedback Loops
% Consider the following feedback loop
%
% <<../Figures/NDDFeedbackLoops_Fig01.png>>
%
% where
K = 2;
G = tf([1 2],[1 .5 3])

%%
% You can compute the closed-loop transfer function |H| from r to y in 
% at least two ways:
%
% * Using the |feedback| command
% * Using the formula
%
% $$ H = {G \over 1+GK} $$
%
% To compute |H| using |feedback|, type
H = feedback(G,K)

%%
% To compute |H| from the formula, type
H2 = G/(1+G*K)
  
%% Why Using FEEDBACK is Better
% A major issue with computing |H| from the formula is that it inflates 
% the order of the closed-loop transfer function. In the
% example above, |H2| has double the order of |H|. This is because 
% the expression |G/(1+G*K)| is evaluated as a ratio of the two transfer
% functions |G| and |1+G*K|. If
%
% $$ G(s) = {N(s) \over D(s)} $$
%
% then |G/(1+G*K)| is evaluated as:
%
% $${N \over D} \left( \frac{D+KN}{D} \right)^{-1} = \frac{ND}{D(D+KN)}.$$
% 
% As a result, the poles of |G| are added to both the numerator and
% denominator of |H|. You can confirm this by looking at the ZPK
% representation:
zpk(H2)

%%
% This excess of poles and zeros can negatively impact the accuracy of your results
% when dealing with high-order
% transfer functions, as demonstrated in the next example. This example 
% involves a 17th-order transfer function |G|. As you did before, use both
% approaches to compute the closed-loop transfer function for |K=1|:
load numdemo G
H1 = feedback(G,1);          % good
H2 = G/(1+G);                % bad

%% 
% To have a point of reference, also compute an FRD model containing the 
% frequency response of G and apply |feedback| to the frequency response
% data directly:
w = logspace(2,5.1,100);
H0 = feedback(frd(G,w),1);

%%
% Then compare the magnitudes of the closed-loop responses:
h = sigmaplot(H0,'b',H1,'gREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH',H2,'r');
legend('Reference H0','H1=feedback(G,1)','H2=G/(1+G)','location','southwest')
setoptions(h,'YlimMode','manual','Ylim',{[-60 0]})

%%
% The frequency response of |H2| is inaccurate for frequencies below 2e4
% rad/s. This inaccuracy can be traced to the
% additional (cancelling) dynamics introduced near z=1. Specifically, |H2|
% has about twice as many poles and zeros near z=1 as |H1|.  As a result,
% |H2(z)| has much poorer accuracy near z=1, which distorts the response
% at low frequencies. See the demo <NDDModelType.html "Using the Right Model Representation"> 
% for more details.
