%% Simulink(R) Power Window Controller With CAN Communication
%  
% The commands to control window movement are typically communicated over 
% a controller area network (CAN). In this model, the switches that may 
% be located in the center console of the vehicle and that produce the 
% commands are included. 
% 
% You must install SimMechanics(TM), SimPowerSystems(TM),
% Signal Processing Blockset(TM), Simulink(R) Fixed Point(TM), and
% xPC Target(TM) to run this power window demo.
