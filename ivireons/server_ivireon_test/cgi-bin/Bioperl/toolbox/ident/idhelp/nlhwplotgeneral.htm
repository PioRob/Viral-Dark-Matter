<center><h3>Hammerstein-Wiener Model Plot</h3></center>

<p>Hammerstein-Wiener model plot offers an interface to explore
the characteristics of the model on a block-by-block basis. A Hammerstein-Wiener
model is a series connection of a linear model block with static nonlinearities
at it input and output channels. The figure shows this block-diagram at
the top, containing three clickable blocks: u_NL (input nonlinearity), Linear
Block and y_NL (output nonlinearity). </p>

<ul>
<li>Click on the block labeled "u_NL" (the leftmost block) to view a plot of
    the input nonlinearities as a function of input data.</li>
<li>Click on the block labeled "Linear Block" (the middle block) to view the
    response plots of the embedded linear model. The response plot types available
    are: step, bode, impulse and pole-zero map.</li>
<li>Click on the block labeled "y_NL" (the rightmost block) to view a plot
    of the output nonlinearities as a function of its inputs. Note that an input to
    the output nonlinearity block is the output of the embedded linear model.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Plots for I/O nonlinearity blocks</b>:<br>
The plots are shown for one channel at a time. The popup menu above the plot axes 
allows the selection of channel whose nonlinearity is being viewed. Options menu 
option – “Set input range...” allows setting the limits of x-axis of the plot. 
Zoom and Pan options are also available from the Style menu to explore the shape 
of the nonlinearity.</p>

<p><b>Plots for Linear Block</b>:<br>
The linear block represents the embedded linear model in the
Hammerstein-Wiener model. Exploring this block amounts to viewing its response
plots in time and frequency domains (as available for any linear model). In the
view for this block, two popup menus are offered: one for selecting the
I/O pair whose response is being viewed and the other for selecting the type of
plot: Step, Bode, Impulse or Pole-Zero Map. Select an I/O pair and a plot type
using these popup menus. Time span may be set (available from the Options menu)
for the Step and Impulse plots, while Frequency range may be set for the Bode
plot.</p>
