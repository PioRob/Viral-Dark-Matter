%MINUS  Matrix difference between fi objects
%   C = MINUS(A,B) subtracts matrix B from matrix A.
%   A and B must have the same dimensions unless one is a scalar.
%   A scalar can be subtracted from another object of any size.
%   C = MINUS(A,B) is called for the syntax A - B when A or B is a fi 
%   object.
%   MINUS does not support fi objects of data type boolean.
