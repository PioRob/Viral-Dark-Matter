<title>Importing an IDDATA or IDFRD Object</title>
<center><h3>Importing an IDDATA or IDFRD Object</h3></center><p>

This dialog is used to import the data in the MATLAB workspace as an IDDATA object or an IDFRD object. 
The imported data is added to the Data Board in the ident window.<p>

<b>Data Format for Signals</b> pop-up menu options:<br>
<b>IDDDATA or IDFRD/FRD</b> is selected<p>

<b>Workspace Variable</b><br>
Enter a data variable name in the <b>Object</b> field.<br>
The Import Data dialog is automatically populated with information about the selected object.
You can change any information except the frequency units for frequency domain data - rad/s is always
used in the GUI. However you can freely change frequency units in the plots.<p>

<b>Data Information</b><br>
<b>Data name</b> (Optional) Enter any string. The data set 
is labeled with this name in the ident window.<p>
The fields you see in this window are different for time-domain and frequency-domain data.<br>
For time-domain data, enter the <b>Starting time</b> and <b>Sampling interval</b> to specify the time scales 
in the time plot. The sampling interval also determines the frequency scale for frequency-domain plots, 
as well as how you interpret the data for continuous-time models. <p>

For frequency-domain data and frequency response data (IDFRD), etner the <b>Sampling interval</b> 
and <b>Frequency unit</b>. The <b>Sampling interval</b> is used to interpret the data when building models, 
but does not affect the frequency scales because the data object contains its own 
frequency information. The <b>Frequency unit</b> is the unit of the object's frequency vector. 
The unit is always converted to rad/s when you import the object into the GUI.<p>

Click the <b>More</b> button to expand the dialog and specify the properties that 
associate the data with, <br>
<b>Channel Names</b> designate the individual channels in the input and output data. Enter the names without quotes and separated by commas. 
Default names for input channels are <tt>u1</tt>, <tt>u2</tt>,... (the maximum number of channels is specified by input dimensions).
Similarly, the output channels are named as <tt>y1</tt>, <tt>y2</tt>, .... The noise
sources are automatically named for the corresponding output:
<tt>e@yname</tt> is the name of the disturbance that is additive to the
output with channel name <tt>yname</tt>.<br>
The number of names must equal the number of channels.<p>  

<b>Physical Units of Variables</b> <br>
(Optional) Enter the units for the measured variables. These are used
only for plot information.<br>
Enter units as comma separated strings without quotes.<p>

<b>Notes</b> <br>
Enter any text that describes the data and the models.  The notes remain 
associated with the data and any models that are estimated from it.<p>

To hide the expanded pane, click <b>Less</b>. <p>
Click <b>Import</b> to import the data set. The data icon is added to the
 Data Board in the ident window.<p>
 
To restore all default values, click <b>Reset</b>.<p>

<p>
<p>
You construct IDDATA objects at the command line by using the constructor <p>
<tt>DATA = IDDATA(Output,Input,SamplingInterval)</tt><p>
Type HELP IDDATA or IDPROPS IDDATA at the command line for more information.<p>

You construct IDFRD objects at the command line by using the constructor<p>
<tt>DATFR = IDFRD(Response, Frequencies, SamplingInterval)</tt><br>
or<br>
<tt>DATFR = IDFRD(Model) </tt><br>
or <br>
<tt>DATFR = SPA(DATA)</tt><br>
or<br>
<tt>DATFR = SPAFDR(DATA)</tt><p>
Type HELP IDFRD, SPA or SPAFDR at the command line for details.<p>
