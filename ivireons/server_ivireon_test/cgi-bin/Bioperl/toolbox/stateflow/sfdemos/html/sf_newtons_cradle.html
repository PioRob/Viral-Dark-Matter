%% Modeling Newton's Cradle
% 
% The popular toy called "Netwon's cradle" consists of a row of (usually)
% seven identical balls which are hung from a common height. At rest they
% are arranged such that they just touch each other. One or more balls from
% one end are then raised from their rest position and released. 
%
% An interesting consequence of elastic collisions between the balls is
% that the balls which are released seem to come to a stop and an equal
% number of balls from the other end get released (with almost the same
% energy as the incoming balls). The balls in the middle do not seem to
% move much at all although they are responsible for transferring momentum
% from one end to another.

% This model uses a simple elastic collision model to describe the
% interactions between the balls. The Stateflow(R) chart uses local variables
% to to depict the continuous states of the system, namely the position |p|
% and the velocity |v|. Note that both these local variables are defined
% to have "Update method" as "continuous". This means that you can refer to
% their derivatives as |p_dot| and |v_dot| respectively. Since the nominal
% dynamics of all the balls is identical, we can use vector assignments to
% describe them en-masse as:
% 
%  p_dot = v;
% v_dot = -g/l*sin(p);
% 
% Note that |p_dot| and |v_dot| are not chart local variables. They are
% automatically created because |p| and |v| are defined to be "continuous".
