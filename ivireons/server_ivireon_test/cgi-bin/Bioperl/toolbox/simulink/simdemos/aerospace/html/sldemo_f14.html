%% F-14 Longitudinal Flight Control
% 
% This demonstration models a flight control for the longitudinal motion of a Grumman Aerospace 
% F-14 Tomcat.  First order linear approximations of the aircraft and actuator behavior are connected
% to an analog flight control design that uses the pilot's stick pitch command as the set point for the 
% aircraft's pitch attitude and uses aircraft pitch angle and pitch rate to determine commands.   A 
% simplified Dryden wind gust model is incorporated to perturb the system.
% 
% Some updates to the original f14.mdl file included in this version:
% 
% The model scope for viewing signals, Scope1, was created using the Signal and Scope Manager
% from the Tools menu.  The Signal and Scope Manager allows you to instrument your model
% without having to add blocks to the model.  If you close a model scope, such as for batch
% simulations, you can later reopen it by double-clicking the "glasses" icon on the signal of 
% interest.
% 
% Parameters for the model are stored in a file named f14dat.m.  This file is loaded by the model
% into the model workspace.  You can view and edit data in the model workspace directly by
% using the Model Explorer, which is launched using the View/Model Explorer menu item or by
% launching it from the Model Explorer toolbar button in the Simulink(R) editor.
