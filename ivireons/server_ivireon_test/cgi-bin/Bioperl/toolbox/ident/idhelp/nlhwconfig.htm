<title>Help: Hammerstein-Wiener Model Configuration</title>

<body>

<center><h2>Hammerstein-Wiener Model Configuration</h2></center>

<p>Hammerstein-Wiener model represents a series form of
nonlinearity where the inputs and outputs to an Output-Error type linear model
are distorted by static nonlinearities. </p>

<p>Configuration of these models involves two steps – choosing
the type of nonlinearity for each channel and selecting the orders for the
embedded linear model. The two tabbed panels, titled "I/O Nonlinearity" and
"Linear Block", facilitate these two steps. </p>

<center><h3>I/O Nonlinearity</h3></center>

<p>In the panel for I/O Nonlinearity, there is a table listing
all the input and output channels and the type of static nonlinearity on each
channel. The first column lists the channel names. For each channel, choose the
type of nonlinearity in the second column and configure its properties in the
third and fourth columns. All configurations have to be made for one row at a
time.</p>

<p>The second column specifies the type of nonlinearity on a
channel. Clicking on an entry in the second column reveals a popup menu from
where the type of nonlinearity may be changed. By default, nonlinearities on
all channels are set to Piecewise linear. Available choices for nonlinearities
are: Sigmoid network, Saturation, Dead zone, Piecewise linear (default),
Wavelet network, One-dimensional polynomial, Custom network and None. "None" indicates 
an absence of nonlinearity in the corresponding I/O channel. For one-dimension polynomial 
nonlinearity (POLY1D), the "number of units" refers to the degree of the polynomial.</p>

<p>In the third column of the table, specify the number of
units to be used in the nonlinearity selected in the second column. For
Saturation and Dead zone, the number of units is inactive (this option is not applicable). 
Similarly, there is no value for number of units if nonlinearity is set to None. 
For wavelet network, this table cell is an editable popup menu: you may either 
choose one of the three listed option ("Select automatically", "10", "Select 
interactively during estimation") or type in a positive integer in the cell. 
For One-dimensional Polynomial nonlinearity, enter the degree of the polynomial in this column 
(default: second degree).</p>

<p>The fourth column of the table offers more options for
configuring the chosen nonlinearity (i.e. the nonlinearity type listed in the
second column of the same row). </p>

<ul>
 <li>Wavelet Network: If nonlinearity type is Wavelet network,
     this column offers an Advanced... button. <a href="wavenet_adv.htm">Advanced
     properties</a> related to the structure of the wavelet network, such as
     Dilation step and Maximum number of levels, may be configured by clicking
     on this button. See the documentation on “wavenet” for information on
     these properties. </li>
 <li>Saturation, Dead Zone and Piecewise Linear: The fourth
     column contains a button called Initial value.... Press this button to
     (optionally) specify the <a href="nlinitvalueeditor.htm">initial values of
     the breakpoints for saturation, dead zone or piecewise linear nonlinearity</a>.
     For saturation, the breakpoints denote the two ends of the linear
     interval. For dead zone, the breakpoints are the two end of the zero
     (dead) interval. For piecewise linear case, the number of breakpoints
     equals the number of units specified in the third column of the table.</li>
 <li>Sigmoid Network or None: No options are offered.</li>
 <li>One-dimensional polynomial: Enter the <a href="poly1dcoeffeditor.htm"> 
     initial values </a> (optional) of the polynomial coefficients, as a row 
     vector. The length of the coefficients vector is D+1, where D is the Degree
     of the polynomial (entered in column 3 of the I/O Nonlinearity table).</li>
 <li>Custom Network: The fourth column contains a button called "Unit function...". Press
     this button to <a href="customnetunitfcndlg.htm">specify a unit function</a> 
     for the custom network. Note that specification of a unit function is necessary 
     for the custom network to be functional.
</ul>

<p>Note: The option "None" for the type of nonlinearity implies
absence of nonlinearity on that channel. This is equivalent to choosing
"unitgain" as type of nonlinearity in the corresponding IDNLHW model object 
(when working in the MATLAB Command Window). For more information on this choice, 
see documentation on nonlinearity estimator called "unitgain".</p><hr>

<center><h3>Linear Block</h3></center>
<p>The linear model configuration is similar to that of the corresponding
linear OE model. Orders of polynomials B and F and the input delay nk need to
be specified in the table titled "Model Order". These values must be entered
for one output at a time. The output to configure may be changed in the popup
labeled "Choose output". Click on the "Use same orders for all outputs"
checkbox to use the same order values for all outputs.</p>

<p>The first column of table lists the input channels. Orders
of polynomials B and F and the input delay (nk) have to be chosen for each input
channel. </p>

<p>In second column, enter the order of numerator polynomial B,
which is equal to the number of zeros+1 in the corresponding linear model.</p>

<p>In third column, enter the order of denominator polynomial
F, which is equal to the number of poles in the corresponding linear model.</p>

<p>Press Infer Input Delay... button (located beneath the Model
Order table) to determine delay from each input to each output (that is, entries of
the fourth column of table: nk) graphically.</p>
