Step 1: MAMP<br>
MAMP is a set of software, which allows you to run web-pages from your machine. This interface utilizes web-pages and programs to use the ANN software.<br>
First, download, install, and run MAMP on your machine. The software can be found at this location <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">Here!</a><br>
Make sure to click "start servers", and wait for the light next to "Apache Server" to turn green. (the machine will see itself as a server).<br>

Next, find the MAMP directory on your machine; it may be in the "Applications" directory, and should look like this:<br>
<img src="/pics/mamp_dir.png" alt="nerding" width="450" height="300" /></img><br>
Replace the "htdocs" and "cgi-bin" directories with those found in the ANNIE packet (drag those folders from the packet to the MAMP folder, and click "Replace".<br><br>
Finally, open a web-browser, and try to go to: http://localhost/<br>
It will hopefully look like this:<br>
