<p>The panel corresponding to a time series data set contains tools for viewing, editing, 
and manipulating the data. To access additional tools, including copying data sets, 
right click the data set in the tree browser in the left panel, and select the 
appropriate option from the context menu. </p>
<p>To graphically view a time series data set, drag and drop a time series data set 
from the tree browser onto one of the following nodes in the tree: <b>Time Plots</b>, 
<b>Spectral Plots</b>, <b>XY Plots</b>, <b>Correlations</b>, and <b>Histograms</b>.</p>
<p>In addition to creating plots of the data, within the Time Series Data panel you 
can add and delete data, define attributes of the data such as units and data 
status codes, add events to the data, and redefine the time.</p>
