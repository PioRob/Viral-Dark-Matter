<TITLE> Preprocessing Data </TITLE>
<center><h3>Preprocessing Data</h3></center><p>
<b>Preprocess</b> pop-up menu in the ident window contains commands for creating new data sets 
based on the <i>Working Data</i> set. 
The new data sets are inserted into the <a href="idmw.htm#datamod">Data Board</a>.
The content of the pop-up menu depends on whether the Working Data is time-domain, frequency-domain
or a frequency function. (Marked by white, light green and light brown background colors,
respectively).
<dl>
<dt><a href="idselio.htm"><b>Select channels</b></a>
<dd>Allows you to select a subset of the input and output channels of the data set.
The numbering of the inputs and outputs is consistent throughout all data sets
created from an original set.

<dt><a href="idselexp.htm"><b>Select experiments</b></a> (Not used for frequency function data)
<dd>When the data set contains several experiments, allows you to
select subsets of the experiments 

<dt><a href="idmergeexp.htm"><b>Merge experiments</b></a> (Not used for frequency function data)
<dd>Allows you to merge data sets into multi-experiment sets. Useful
when you what to use more data to estimate a model, but the data sets have been
obtained at different occasions and cannot simply be concatenated.

<dt><a href="idsel.htm"><b>Select range</b></a> (Only used for time domain data)
<dd>Allows you to select portions of the data set to be used for estimation and 
validation purposes 

<dt><b>Remove means</b> (Only used for time domain data)
<dd>Removes the mean values from both the input and output sequences

<dt><b>Remove trends</b> (Only used for time domain data)
<dd>Estimates and removes a linear trend from the input and output signals. 
For more information, see MATLAB help on the DETREND function.

<dt><a href="idfilt.htm"><b>Filter</b></a>
<dd>Allows you to filter the data set
<dt><a href="iddec.htm"><b>Resample</b></a>
 <dd>Allows you to change the sampling interval by using interpolation and 
       decimation
<dt>
<a href="trf.htm"><b>Transform data</b></a>
<dd>Allows you to transform to frequency function data, as well as between time- and
frequency-domain data.

<dt><b>Quick start</b>
<dd>Creates three new data sets from the <i>Working Data</i> set. 
First the mean values are removed, then the new data is split into two halves - the first half 
becomes the new Working Data set and the second half becomes the
<i>Validation Data</i> set. This command also opens the plot window. For multi-experiment data, there is no split into 
the estimation (working) and validation data.
