<title>State-space Models</title>
<center><h3>State-space Models</h3></center>
The basic state-space model in innovations form can be written as<p>

               x(t+1) = A x(t)  + B u(t)  +  K e(t)<br>
                 y(t) = C x(t)  + D u(t)  +    e(t)<p>

The SITB supports two kinds of parameterizations of state-space models:
 <a href="#blackbox">Black box</a>, free parameterizations, and parameterizations
 <a href="#tailor">tailor made</a> to the application.<p>
<b>To estimate a state space model</b>, select <b>Estimate->Parametric Models</b> in the 
System Identification Tool window. In the dialog that opens, choose 
State space as the model structure, and enter the desired order. 
The delays from the different inputs u can be entered within square brackets.
The default values of the delays are all 1. This means that the D-matrix is
fixed to zero. The estimation of the initial state x(0) is governed by the
pop-up menu Initial State in the Parametric Model window.<p>
 
The order editor also gives the possibility to choose two variables that may
have an influence on the quality of the N4SID estimated. This estimate is also used
to initialize the PEM estimate. The N4sid Options are
<a name = "n4o">
<dl>
<dt>N4Weight</dt>
<dd>This governs the pre- and post-weighting matrices that are used at an
SVD step in the algorithm. The choices are 'Auto', 'MOESP', and 'CVA'.
   'Auto' gives an automatic choice. MOESP is the method by Verhaegen and
   'CVA' is the canonical variable algorithm by Akaike and Larimore.
<dt> N4Horizon</dt>
<dd> This vector determines the predictions horizons used.
      N4Horizon =[r,sy,su], where
    r is the maximum prediction horizon, 
 sy is the number of past outputs used in the predictors, and
   su is the number of past inputs used in the predictors. If you enter just one number
all horizons will be equal to that number. Taking sy = 0 gives
a method that does not take the noise influence into account. There is no
simple theory for how to choose N4Horizon. Setting it to 'Auto' or leaving it empty,
 which is the
default, gives a procedure, based on the Akaike AIC criterion, that makes the choice 
guided by the estimation data. <p> Since the choice of horizons may be difficult, it
may be a good idea to test several choices.
    If N4Horizon has several rows, each row will be tried. A plot will be shown
that describes the fit as a function of the different choices. For a simple test with
various values of the horizons, with all being the same in each try, just enter a column
vector, like [5:30]';
<br> You can also enter any variable name in the N4Horizon field, that will be evaluated in
the workspace to give the desired option. <p>
Note that the N4Horison also can be directly entered in the <b>Orders</b> field of the 
Parametric Models dialog, by writing it within parenthesis after the order. <br>Example:
To estimate a 5th order model with input delay 3 and N4Horizon [8 7 7], enter in
the orders field: <br> 5 [3] ([8 7 7]).
<p>
To see what default choices of N4Horizon have been used, export the model to the workspace
and check the field  model.est.N4Horizon. When Order Selection has been used, the resulting
N4Horizon is also inserted into the Order Editor.
 </dl>

Note that in the black box case, there is a special feature to select the
model order by entering a vector (like 1:10) for the model order. You can 
push the <b>Order selection</b> button to fill out the model order field in 
this case.

<center><h3>Black Box State-space Models</h3></center>
Use the pop-up menu to choose the model order, i.e. the dimension of the 
state/space vector, or enter it directly into the <b>Orders</b> field in the
 Parametric Models dialog. 
<p>By entering a vector (e.g. 1:10), all orders are computed 
using a preliminary method, and you will have to choose order(s) based on
 information in a special graph. You can also use the button 
<b>Order selection</b> to fill out the Model order field with a default 
model order range.<p>
There are two basic methods for the estimation: <a href="#pemn4">PEM and N4SID</a>
<p>
Note that the delays from the inputs can also be set in the order editor.<p>
Selecting <b>Disturbance model</b> in the parametric model window such that
the matrix K is fixed to zero, gives an Output Error method.<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>PEM:</b> <dd>A standard prediction error/maximum likelihood method,
 based on iterative minimization of a criterion. The iterations are started
 from parameter values that are computed from N4SID. The parametrization of 
the matrices A, B, C, D, and K is free an adjusted to be numerically well
conditioned.<p>
The search for a minimum is controlled by a number of options. These are
 accessed from the Options button in the 
<a href="iduiiter.htm">Iteration control</a>  dialog.
<P>
<dt><b>N4SID:</b> <dd>A subspace-based method based on projections, 
that does not use iterative search.<p>
The quality of the resulting estimates may significantly depend on  the
N4sid Options <a href="#n4o">N4Weight and N4Horizon</a></dl><p>
See the commands PEM and N4SID in the manual for more information.<p>

<title>Arbitrary State-Space Model Structures</title>
<a name="tailor">
<center><h3>Tailor-made State-space Models</h3></center>
The SITB supports user-defined linear state-space models of arbitrary structure.
 Using the command IDSS known and unknown parameters in the A, B, C, D, K, and X0
 matrices can be easily defined both for discrete and continuous-time models. 
The command IDGREY allows you to use a completely arbitrary structure, defined by
user-written MATLAB file. The properties of these model objects can be easily manipulated.<p>
To use them in conjunction with System Identification Tool, define the appropriate 
structure in the MATLAB Command Window and enter its variable name in the Orders: 
edit box of the Parametric Models dialog.  If desired, select the appropriate iteration 
options for PEM by pressing the <a href="iduiiter.htm">Iteration control</a> button.
