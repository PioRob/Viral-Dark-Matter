% Compiler
%   mcc              - MATLAB Compiler driver. Called from
%                      either the MATLAB prompt or the system
%                      prompt.
%
% Component tools
%   mbuild           - Used by the compiler to compile and build
%                      certain components. It must be configured
%                      for the compiler to work. At the MATLAB
%                      prompt issue:
%
%                      >> mbuild -setup
%
%                      and answer any questions.
%
%  extractCTF        - (extractCTF.exe on PC) is a stand-alone
%                      utility to extract a CTF archive without
%                      running the stand-alone application that uses
%                      it. One of the scenarios where this utility
%                      will be useful is for system administrators
%                      who would like to make a MATLAB Compiler-based
%                      application available to the users over the
%                      network and the users do not have write
%                      permission on the network directory.

% MATLAB Common Runtime (MCR) tools
%   
%   MCRInstaller.zip - The MCR package file for a specific architecture,
%                      ARCH, this file is placed in the
%                      directory:
