<title>Confidence Intervals</title>
<center><h3>Confidence Intervals</h3></center><p>
<b>Confidence intervals are toggled on/off in the <b>Options</b> menu.</b><p>
Any estimated model has a degree of uncertainty, which affects the reliability of the various model properties. 
Therefore, all model views have estimated accuracy measures (except the K-step ahead prediction in the 
<b>Model output</b> view). <p>

The uncertainty region is marked by two dash-dotted lines, one on either side of the nominal 
model curve with the same color as the curve.
<p>
The statistical interpretation is that (with the indicated probability) the true system response
 is found within the marked confidence region.
<p>
Caution: This interpretation assumes that the system can be described within the chosen model class and
 that the model has passed validation tests. In addition, the calculations assume that the model errors are small.
<p>
Yuo can set the confidence level as the number of standard deviations of a Gaussian distribution in a dialog,
opened by selecting <b>Options->Set confidence</b>.
<p>
Note: In the <b>Model resids</b> and the <b>Transient resp</b> (Impulse Response and Stem Plot)
views, the confidence lines are on either side zero.
<p>
See BODE, NYQUIST, TFDATA, SSDATA and ZPKDATA in the manual for more information about uncertainty measures.
