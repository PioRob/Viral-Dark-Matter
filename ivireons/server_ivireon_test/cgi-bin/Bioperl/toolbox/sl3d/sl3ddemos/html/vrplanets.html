%% Planetary System
% 
% The vrplanets example shows the dynamic visualization of the first 4 planets of the Solar
% system, Moon orbiting around Earth and Sun rotating itself. The model uses the real
% properties of the spatial bodies. Only the relative planet sizes and the distance between
% the Earth and the Moon are adjusted to provide an interesting view.
% 
% There are several viewpoints defined in the virtual scene - both static and attached to an
% observer on Earth. You can see that the planet bodies are not visualized as perfect
% spheres. This model was simplified by using the VRML Sphere graphic primitive which is
% rendered this way. If we wanted to make the planets more realistic, we could use the
% more complex IndexedFaceSet node type.
% 
% Mutual gravity accelerations of the bodies are computed using Simulink(R) matrix-type.
