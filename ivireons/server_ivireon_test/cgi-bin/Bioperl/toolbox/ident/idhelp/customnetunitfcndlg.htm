<title>Help: Specifying unit function for Custom Network</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Unit Function for Custom Network</h3></center>

The dialog for specifying the unit function for a custom network is 
launched by: 
<ul>
<li> Pressing the Specify... button on the panel for properties of 
     Custom Network under the Model Properties tab of Nonlinear ARX model structure 
     (in Nonlinear Models window).
     </li>
<li> Pressing the Unit Function ... button in the fourth column of the
     table in the Hammerstein-Wiener model's I/O Nonlinearity panel in the 
     Nonlinear Models window.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The unit function <tt>H</tt> may be specified in two ways: as a function handle,
    or as a name of a MATLAB or MEX-file. <tt>H</tt> should represent a function of the
    form <tt>[f, g, a] = function_name(x)</tt>, where <tt>f</tt> is the value of the function, 
    <tt>g = df/dx</tt> and <tt>a</tt> indicates the unit function's active range 
    (that is, the derivative <tt>g</tt> is significantly non zero in the interval
    <tt>[-a a]</tt>). This function must be "vectorized": for a vector or matrix 
    <tt>x</tt>, the output arguments <tt>f</tt> and <tt>g</tt> must have the same 
    size as <tt>x</tt>, computed element-by-element.
</p>

<p> Note that it is necessary to specify the unit function when choosing the 
Custom Network as a form of nonlinearity. The estimation will not work unless a valid 
unit function has been specified. See the function "gaussunit.m" (type "edit gaussunit" 
in MATLAB Command Window) as an example of a valid unit function.
</p>

<b>How to specify the unit function:</b>
<ul>
   <li>Choose the "Function handle" radio button to specify the name or expression for 
    a function handle. The specified variable or expression will be evaluated in the 
    MATLAB base workspace. </li>

    <li>Choose the "MATLAB or MEX-file" radio button to specify the name of an M file or an MEX file. 
    You can either type in the name of the file (with full path, if the file is not on
    MATLAB path), or browse for it by clicking on the Browse... button. </li>
</ul>

<p>
    After specifying the unit function as a function handle or name of a file, click 
    on Apply or OK button to insert the chosen unit function into the custom network.
    Hit Cancel to close the dialog.
