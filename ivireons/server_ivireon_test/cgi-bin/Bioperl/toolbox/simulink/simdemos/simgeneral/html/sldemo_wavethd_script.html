%% Create a Table in Double Precision Floating Point
% The following commands make a 256 point sine wave and measure its 
% total harmonic distortion when sampled first on the points and then 
% by jumping with a delta of 2.5 points per step using linear 
% interpolation. Similar computations are done by replacing the sine values with
% CORDIC sine approximation. For frequency-based applications, 
% spectral purity can be more important than absolute error in the table.
%
% The file  <matlab:edit('ssinthd.m') ssinthd.m> is the core function in this demo.
% It is used for calculating total harmonic distortion (THD) for digital 
% sine wave generation with or without interpolation. This THD algorithm 
% proceeds over an integral number of waves to achieve accurate results. The 
% number of wave cycles used is A.  Since the step size 'delta' is A/B and 
% traversing A waves will hit all points in the table at least one time, which 
% is needed to accurately find the average THD across a full cycle.
%
% The relationship used to calculate THD is:
%
%      THD = (ET - EF) / ET
%
% where ET = total energy, and 
%       EF = fundamental energy
%
% The energy difference between ET and EF is spurious energy.

%% The Same Table, Implemented in Fixed Point
% Now convert the floating point table into a 24 bit fractional 
% number using 'nearest' rounding.  The new table is tested for 
% total harmonic distortion in direct lookup mode at 1, 2, and 3 
% points per step, then with fixed point linear interpolation.

thd_linterp_2p5 = ssinthd(is, 5/2, 2*N, 5, 'fixptlinear')

%% Compare Results for Different Tables and Methods
% Choosing a table step rate of 8.25 points per step (33/4), jump through 
% the double precision and fixed point tables in both direct and linear

% whose input angle in radians is time based (computed using a clock). 
% This section tests the assumption that the clock input would return 
% repeatable results from the sin() function for period 2*pi. The following

%% Survey of Behavior for Direct Lookup and Linear Interpolation
% The file <matlab:edit('sldemo_sweeptable_thd.m') sldemo_sweeptable_thd.m>
% performs a full frequency sweep of the fixed point tables and will let
% us more thoroughly understand the behavior of this design.  Total harmonic 
% distortion of the 24-bit fractional fixed point table is measured at
