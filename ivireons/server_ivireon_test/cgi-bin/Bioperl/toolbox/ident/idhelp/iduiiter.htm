<title>Help: Iteration Information</title>
<center><h3>Iteration Information</h3></center>

The estimate is computed by iterative search for a model that gives the 
minimal prediction error variance when applied to the working data.
The Parametric Model and Process Model dialogs provide online information about the
progress of this search.<p>
Each of these dialogs displays the current Iteration number, the current Fit, and the Improvement in the fit.<p>
The Fit is defined as follows: <p>
Loss Function = the sum of squares of output prediction errors normalized by the
number of data points.<p>
For multi-output models, the Loss Function is the determinant of the covariance matrix of
the prediction errors.<p> 
When you select the 'Trace' check box, a full trace of the loss functions, parameter values, and
update information is given in the MATLAB command window.<p>
Click 'Stop Iterations' to stop the search and save the results after the current iteration
has been completed. Click 'Continue' to continue the iterations from the current model.<p>

The iterative search is controlled by a number of design variables, specified in the Options for Criterion Minimization dialog. 
You can access this dialog by clicking the
<a href="idioopt.htm">Iteration Options</a> button in the Parametric Models dialog.
