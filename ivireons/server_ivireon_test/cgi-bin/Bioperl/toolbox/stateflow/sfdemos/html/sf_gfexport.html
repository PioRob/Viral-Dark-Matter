%% Exporting a Graphical Function
% 
% This demonstration illustrates how graphical functions can be exported and
% used as a means for accessing data. The output shown in the scope block, is
% equal to 1 when the manual switch is in the On_switch state, or 0 when the
% switch is in the Off_switch state.
% 
% The Caller chart is triggered by the Manual Switch. Graphical functions
% which are defined in the Callee chart, are then called by the Caller chart.
% In the Callee chart, the output is set to 0 in state A and set to 1 in
% state B. The graphical functions which are called by the Caller chart,
% first check if state A is active and then send a transition event signal
% to the appropriate state. This method allows you to create flexible models
% which contain different triggering events that define the final output.
