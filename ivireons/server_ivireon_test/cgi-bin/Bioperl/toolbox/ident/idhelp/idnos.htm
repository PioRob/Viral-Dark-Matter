<title>Setting Time Span</title>
Enter the time span (in TimeUnits) for the transient responses.
<p>
When the  option has been changed, all the curves in the Transient response View are redrawn for the new number of samples, except those curves that correspond to correlation analysis estimates. These will always be given for the number of samples that were chosen at the time the estimate was created.
<p>
The default value is that a suitable time span is estimated from the model. For
IDNLARX and IDNLGREY models the default is 10 TimeUnits.
 The default can be obtained by entering the empty matrix or the word Default.
