function delete(obj)
%DELETE Remove serial port object from memory.
%
%   DELETE(OBJ) removes serial port object, OBJ, from memory. When OBJ
%   is deleted, it becomes an invalid object and cannot be reconnected
%   to the device and should be removed from the workspace with CLEAR.
%
%   If multiple references to a serial port object exist in the workspace,
%   then deleting one serial port object invalidates the remaining
%   references. These remaining references should be cleared from the
%   workspace with the CLEAR command.
%
%   If the serial port object is connected to a device, i.e. has a Status
%   property value of open, the serial port object will be disconnected
%   from the device with the FCLOSE function and then deleted.
%
%   If OBJ is an array of serial port objects and one of the objects
%   cannot be deleted, the remaining objects in the array will be deleted
%   and a warning will be displayed.
%
%   DELETE should be used at the end of a serial port session.
%
%   See also SERIAL/FCLOSE, SERIAL/ISVALID.
