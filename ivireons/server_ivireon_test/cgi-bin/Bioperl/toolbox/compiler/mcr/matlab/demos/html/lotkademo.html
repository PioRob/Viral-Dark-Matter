%% Numerical Integration of Differential Equations
% ODE23 and ODE45 are functions for the numerical solution of ordinary
% differential equations.  They employ variable step size Runge-Kutta
% integration methods.  ODE23 uses a simple 2nd and 3rd order pair of formulas
% for medium accuracy and ODE45 uses a 4th and 5th order pair for higher
% accuracy.  This demo shows their use on a simple differential equation.

%%
% Consider the pair of first order ordinary differential equations known as the
% Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.
%
%     y1' = (1 - alpha*y2)*y1
%
%     y2' = (-1 + beta*y1)*y2
%
% The functions y1 and y2 measure the sizes of the prey and predator populations
% respectively.  The quadratic cross term accounts for the interactions between
% the species.  Note that the prey population increases when there are no
% predators, but the predator population decreases when there are no prey.

%%
% To simulate a system, create a function that returns a column vector of
% state derivatives, given state and time values.  For this example, we've
% created a file called LOTKA.M.

type lotka

%%
% To simulate the differential equation defined in LOTKA over the interval 0 < t
% < 15, invoke ODE23.  Use the default relative accuracy of 1e-3 (0.1 percent).

% Define initial conditions.
t0 = 0;
tfinal = 15;
y0 = [20 20]';   
% Simulate the differential equation.
tfinal = tfinal*(1+eps);
[t,y] = ode23('lotka',[t0 tfinal],y0);

% step, but also takes larger steps.  Nevertheless, the output of ODE45 is smooth
% because by default the solver uses a continuous extension formula to produce
% output at 4 equally spaced time points in the span of each step taken.  The
% plot compares this result against the previous.
