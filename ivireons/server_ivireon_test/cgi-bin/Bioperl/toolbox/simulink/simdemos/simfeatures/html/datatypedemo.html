%% Data Typing in Simulink(R)
% 
% This demonstration shows how to use data types in Simulink.  The model used in this
% demo converts a double-precision sine wave having an amplitude of 150 to various
% data types and displays the converted signals on two scopes.
% 
% The first scope shows the original sine wave and the result of converting this signal to
% signed and unsigned 8-bit integer data types with saturation enabled.  The bottom axes
% show the boolean results of comparing the signed and unsigned integer values.
% 
% The second scope shows the original sine wave and the result of converting this signal to
% two fixed-point data types: one high-resolution, the other lower resolution.  The bottom
% axes show the result of mapping the sine wave to an enumerated data type
% that indicates whether the signal is positive, negative or zero.
% 
% Similar data type support exists for parameters and states.  Simulink also supports other
% integer and floating-point data types, such as, single, int16, and uint32, and fixed-point
% types with slope/bias and wordlengths from 1 to 128 bits.  You can also define types for
% bus signals and aliases for existing types.
% 
% NOTE:
% If you do not have a license for Simulink(R) Fixed Point(TM) then the fixed-point signals will be
% replaced by single-precision signals.
