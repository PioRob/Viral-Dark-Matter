%FEOF   Test for end-of-file.
%   ST = FEOF(FID) returns 1 if the end-of-file indicator for the
%   file with file identifier FID has been set, and 0 otherwise.
%   The end-of-file indicator is set when a read operation on the file
%   associated with the FID attempts to read past the end of the file.
