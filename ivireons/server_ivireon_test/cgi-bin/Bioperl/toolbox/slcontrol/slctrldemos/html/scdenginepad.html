% This demo illustrates how to obtain the frequency
% response of Simulink(R) models when analytical block-by-block
% linearization does not provide accurate answer due to event-based dynamics
% in the linearization path. Examples of such systems are models with
% triggered subsystems or models using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) input
% signals. 

%% Step 1: Opening the Model
% Open the Simulink(R) model for engine timing. Note      
% that analytical block-by-block linearization of this model from throttle angle
% to engine speed gives a linearization result of zero due to the triggered
% subsystem "Compression" in the linearization path.
scdengine
mdl = 'scdengine';
io = getlinio(mdl);
linsys = linearize(mdl,io)

%% Step 2: Estimating Frequency Response Using Sinestream Input Signal
% Sinestream input signal is the most reliable input signal for estimating an
% accurate frequency response of a Simulink(R) model using FRESTIMATE. It
% is a signal that is composed of individual sinusoidal signals that are
% appended to the end of each other. FRESTIMATE command simulates the model
% for each frequency in the sinestream input signal, specified in
% "Frequency" parameter, for the corresponding amount of periods, specified
% in "NumPeriods" parameter. After the simulation, FRESTIMATE uses the output signal to compute
% the response at each frequency. Note that FRESTIMATE uses only the 
% periods after the system reaches to steady state for that input
% frequency, specified in "SettlingPeriods" parameter. Create a
% sinestream signal with logarithmically-spaced distinct 
% frequencies between 0.1 and 10 rad/s:
in = frest.Sinestream('Frequency',logspace(-1,1,50),'Amplitude',1e-3)

%%
% Note that by default, each frequency in sinestream input signal is
% simulated for 4 periods, i.e. "NumPeriods" is 4 for all frequencies, and
% the end of first period is specified to be where the system reaches to
% steady state, i.e. "SettlingPeriods" is 1 for all frequencies, thus
% FRESTIMATE uses the last 3 periods of the output signals.

%%
% Using this sinestream input signal, perform the
% frequency response estimation using FRESTIMATE command and plot the
% resulting frequency response data:
[sys,simout] = frestimate(mdl,io,in);
bode(sys)

%%
% You can inspect the estimation results using the FRESTIMATE Simulation Results
% Viewer. The viewer shows time-domain and frequency-domain simulation results
% for the selected frequency(s) and a summary bode plot where you can
% interactively switch between frequencies. The frequencies of the sinestream
% signal are color-coded in all plots.
frest.simView(simout,in,sys);

%%
% You can use the viewer as a tool to diagnose issues. Examples of issues
% that impact the accuracy of the frequency response estimation include:
%
% * Not reaching steady state
% * Excitation of nonlinearities
% * Running into instabilities
%

%% Step 3: Estimating Frequency Response Using Chirp Input Signal
% Another input signal you can use when estimating frequency response data from a
% Simulink(R) model is frequency chirp. Frequency chirp differs from
% sinestream in that the frequency is instantenously varied.

%%
% You can use chirp input signals to obtain quicker frequency
% response estimation. However, the frequency estimation results obtained
% with chirp input could be less reliable than the ones obtained with
% sinestream input because each frequency is not simulated long enough to
% drive the system to steady state at that frequency. Create a chirp signal    
% that sweeps between the frequencies 0.1 and 10 rad/s logarithmically:
in_chirp = frest.Chirp('FreqRange',[0.1 10],'Amplitude',1e-3,...
    'SweepMethod','logarithmic','NumSamples',3000);

%%
% Using the chirp signal, perform the frequency response estimation:
sys_chirp = frestimate(mdl,io,in_chirp);

%%
% Plot the results obtained with sinestream and chirp input signals
% together:
bode(sys,sys_chirp,'r')

%%
% Close the model:
bdclose('scdengine');
