<title>Help: Initial Values for Saturation, Dead Zone and Piecewise Linear</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Initial Values for Saturation, Dead Zone and Piecewise Linear Nonlinearities</h3></center>

<p>This dialog for specifying initial values of break points is
launched by pressing the Initial value ... button in the fourth column of the
table in the Hammerstein-Wiener model's I/O Nonlinearity panel in the Nonlinear Models 
window. Note that it is not necessary to specify these initial values, since they can 
be determined autmatically by the estimation algorithm during the estimation process.</p>

<p>Saturation, Dead Zone and Piecewise Linear nonlinearities
are among the options available for Hammerstein-Wiener models. These
nonlinearities optionally accept initial values for the locations of
breakpoints. For saturation, the breakpoints denote the two ends of the linear
interval. For dead zone, the breakpoints are the two end of the zero (dead)
interval. For piecewise linear case, the number of breakpoints equals the
number of units.</p><hr>

<center><h3>Saturation</h3></center> 

<p> A dialog titled Saturation Limits is opened by pressing the 
Initial value... button in the I/O Nonlinearity panel. In this dialog, select the radio button 
option to choose between two-sided (default) and one-sided saturation. If the radio button for
one-sided saturation is chosen, choose which limit should be specified – upper
(default) or lower. For the selected option, enter the initial values of the
upper and/or lower limits in the corresponding edit boxes. Enter [] to use
default values.</p><hr>

<center><h3>Dead Zone</h3></center> 
<p>A dialog titled Dead Zone Limits is opened by pressing the 
Initial value... button in the I/O Nonlinearity panel. In this dialog, select the radio button 
option to choose between two-sided (default) and one-sided dead zone. If the radio button for
one-sided dead zone is chosen, choose which limit should be specified – upper
(default) or lower. The upper limit denotes the right (higher) end of the
zero-interval. For the selected option, enter the initial values of the upper
and/or lower limits in the corresponding edit boxes. Enter [] to use default
values.</p> <hr>

<center><h3>Piecewise Linear</h3></center> 
<p>A dialog titled Piecewise Linear Breakpoints is opened by pressing 
the Initial value... button in the I/O Nonlinearity panel. For piecewise linear case,
both the X- (abscissa) and Y- (ordinate) values of the breakpoints may be
assigned. The X values are the "locations" of the breakpoints. The Y values are 
the values of nonlinearity at the corresponding locations. It is common to 
specify only the X values, since the Y values may be unavailable or difficult to 
guess in advance.</p>

<p>In the dialog, use the radio buttons to indicate if only the break point locations (X)
or both the break point locations (X) as well as the nonlinearity values (Y) are being 
specified. For the selected option, enter the initial values for these quantities 
in the corresponding edit boxes. Note that if the nonlinearity values (Y) are specified, 
the break point locations (X coordinates, which should be non-empty and same length 
as number of units in the nonlinearity) must also be specified. Thus, the lengths of 
X and Y vectors must match. However, if only break point locations values are specified, 
the nonlinearity values are estimated automatically during estimation. Enter [] to 
use default values (values determined during estimation).</p>

<p>If defaults ([]) are not used, the length of entered values
must match the number of units in the piecewise linear nonlinearity. The number
of units (= number of breakpoints) is shown at the top of the Piecewise Linear 
BreakPoints dialog.</p>
