<big>iVIREON - identification of VIRions by Ensembles of Neural networks</big><br><br>

Ever feel like there are too many viruses in the world? Don't you wish you could just <i>predict</i> an unknown viral protein's function?<br><br>
iVIREON is here to help! Unlike <i>messy</i> sequence alignment programs, iVIREON utilizes trained Artificial Neural Networks to recognize the<br>
amino acid percent compositions and isoelectric values of your proteins! If it's similar to sequences the ANNs have seen before, they'll predict its function!<br>
It's THAT easy!<br>
Try iVIREON today, FREE!<br><br>
<small>Warning: iVIREON will not be held responsible for lost or damaged sequences, nor sequences which gain sentience and make others feel jealous and inanimate.</small><br><br><br><br>

<big>Instructions:</big><br><br>
Step 1: MAMP<br>
MAMP is a set of software, which allows you to run web-pages from your machine. This interface utilizes web-pages and programs to use the ANN software.<br>
First, download, install, and run MAMP on your machine. The software can be found at this location <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">Here!</a><br>
Make sure to click "start servers", and wait for the light next to "Apache Server" to turn green. (the machine will see itself as a server).<br>

Next, find the MAMP directory on your machine; it may be in the "Applications" directory, and should look like this:<br>

Replace the "htdocs" and "cgi-bin" directories with those found in the ANNIE packet (drag those folders from the packet to the MAMP folder, and click "Replace".<br><br>
Finally, open a web-browser, and try to go to: http://localhost/<br>
It will hopefully look like this:<br>
