<title>Help: Model Order Selection</title>
There are two useful features in ident for selecting good model orders, 
available for ARX and state-space models.<p>
To enter default order ranges, click the <b>Order Selection</b> button in
      the Parametric Models window.<p> 
<b>For ARX models</b>, many models can be estimated simultaneously and
      evaluated by using the validation data. To achieve this, select
      Estimate > Parametric Models from the pop-up menu in the ident
      window. For each required order (na, nb, and nk) enter a
      vector using the MATLAB colon notation. (You can also enter the order in the
      Order Editor, or create the expression as a variable in
      the MATLAB command window and enter the name of this variable in the
      Order field.)<p> 
When you click Estimate, the models that correspond to all order combinations are computed. 
    These models are evaluated using the validation data and their fit is displayed in a special
      dialog. Here you can select which model(s) to enter into
      the model board. This is a counterpart of ARXSTRUC and SELSTRUC
      in the command-line use of the toolbox. <p> 
<b>For state space models</b>, many orders can be evaluated
      simultaneously using the N4SID method. in the Parametric Models dialog,
      specify the model Structure as State Space. In the Orders field, enter the
      orders as a vector by using the MATLAB colon notation. A plot that displays the properties of the
      each corresponding model is opened. Click inside this plot and select the model to be inserted
      into the model board.<p> 
See N4SID in the Command Reference Manual for more information.<p>
