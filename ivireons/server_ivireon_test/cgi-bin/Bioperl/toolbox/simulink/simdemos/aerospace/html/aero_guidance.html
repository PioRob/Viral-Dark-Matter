%% Representing the Airframe in Simulink
%
% The airframe model consists of four principal subsystems, controlled
% through the acceleration-demand autopilot. The Atmosphere model
% calculates the change in atmospheric conditions with changing altitude,
% the Fin Actuator and Sensors models couple the autopilot to the airframe,
% and the Aerodynamics and Equations of Motion model calculates the
% magnitude of the forces and moments acting on the missile body, and
% integrates the equations of motion.

%% International Standard Atmosphere Model
%
% <<../images/guidance_airden.gif>>
%
% The Atmosphere Subsystem that is used is an approximation to the
% International Standard Atmosphere, and is split into two separate
% regions. The troposphere region lies between sea level and 11Km, and in
% this region there is assumed to be a linear temperature drop with
% changing altitude. Above the troposphere lies the lower stratosphere
% region ranging between 11Km and 20Km. In this region the temperature is
% assumed to remain constant.

%% Aerodynamic Coefficients for Constructing Forces and Moments
%
% The Aerodynamics & Equations of Motion Subsystem generates the forces and
% moments applied to the missile in body axes, and integrates the equations
% of motion which define the linear and angular motion of the airframe.

% interpolation using 2-D lookup table blocks.

%% Classical Three Loop Autopilot Design
% 
% The aim of the missile autopilot is to control acceleration normal to the
% missile body. In this demonstration the autopilot structure is a three
% loop design using measurements from an accelerometer placed ahead of the
% center of gravity, and a rate gyro to provide additional damping. The
% controller gains are scheduled on incidence and Mach number, and are
% tuned for robust performance at an altitude of 10,000 ft.
% 
% To design the autopilot using classical design techniques requires that
% linear models of the airframe pitch dynamics be derived about a number of
% trimmed flight conditions. MATLAB(R) can determine the trim conditions, and
% derive linear state space models directly from the non-linear Simulink
% model, saving both time, and aiding in the validation of the model that
% has been created. The functions provided by the MATLAB Control System Toolbox(TM) 
% and Simulink(R) Control Design(TM) allow the designer to visualize the 
% behavior of the airframe open loop frequency (or time) responses. To see
% how to trim and linearize the airframe model you can run the companion
% demonstration, "Trim and Linearize a Missile Airframe".

%% Airframe Frequency Response
% 
% Autopilot designs are carried out on a number of linear airframe models
% derived at varying flight conditions across the expected flight
% envelope. To implement the autopilot in the non-linear model involves
% storing the autopilot gains in 2 dimensional lookup tables, and
% incorporating an anti-windup gain to prevent integrator windup when the
% fin demands exceed the maximum limits. Testing the autopilot in the
% nonlinear Simulink model is then the best way to demonstrate satisfactory
% performance in the presence of non-linearities such as actuator fin and
% rate limits, and with the gains now dynamically varying with changing
% flight condition.

%% Homing Guidance Loop
% 
% The complete Homing Guidance Loop
% consists of a Seeker/Tracker Subsystem which returns measurements of the
% relative motion between the missile and target, and the Guidance Subsystem
% which generates normal acceleration demands which are passed to the autopilot.
% The autopilot is now part of an inner loop within the overall homing guidance
% system. Reference [4] provides information on the differing forms of guidance
% that are currently in use, and provides background information on the analysis
% techniques that are used to quantify guidance loop performance.

%% Guidance Subsystem
% 
% The function of the Guidance subsystem is to not only generate demands 
% during closed loop tracking, but also perform an initial search to locate
% the target position. A Stateflow(R) model is used to control the transfer
% between these differing modes of operation. Switching between modes is

%% Proportional Navigation Guidance
%
% Once the seeker has acquired the target a Proportional Navigation
% Guidance (PNG) law is used to guide the missile until impact. This form
% of guidance law has been used in guided missiles since the 1950s, and can
% be applied to radar, infrared or television guided missiles. The
% navigation law requires measurements of the closing velocity between the
% missile and target, which for a radar guided missile could be obtained
% using a Doppler tracking device, and an estimate for the rate of change
% of the inertial sightline angle.
% 
% <<../images/guidance_sight.gif>>

% *Figure*: Proportional Navigation Guidance Law

%% Seeker/Tracker Subsystem
%
% The aim of the Seeker/Tracker Subsystem is both to drive the seeker
% gimbals to keep the seeker dish aligned with the target, and to provide
% the guidance law with an estimate of the sightline rate. The tracker loop
% time constant *tors* is set to 0.05 seconds, and is chosen as a
% compromise between maximizing speed of response, and keeping the noise
% transmission to within acceptable levels. The stabilization loop aims to
% compensate for body rotation rates, and the gain *Ks*, which is the loop
% cross-over frequency, is set as high as possible subject to the
% limitations of the bandwidth of the stabilizing rate gyro. The sightline
% rate estimate is a filtered value of the sum of the rate of change of the
% dish angle measured by the stabilizing rate gyro, and an estimated
% value for the rate of change of the angular tracking error (*e*) measured
% by the receiver. In this demonstration the bandwidth of the estimator
% filter is set to half that of the bandwidth of the autopilot.

%% Radome Aberration
%
% For radar guided missiles a parasitic feedback effect that is commonly
% modelled is that of radome aberration. It occurs because the shape of the
% protective covering over the seeker distorts the returning signal, and
% then gives a false reading of the look angle to the target. Generally the

% but a commonly used approximation is to assume a linear relationship
% between the gimbal angle and the magnitude of the distortion. In the
% above system, the radome aberration is accounted for in the gain block
% labeled "Radome Aberration". Other parasitic effects, such as
% sensitivity in the rate gyros to normal acceleration, are also often
% modelled to test the robustness of the target tracker and estimator
% filters.
