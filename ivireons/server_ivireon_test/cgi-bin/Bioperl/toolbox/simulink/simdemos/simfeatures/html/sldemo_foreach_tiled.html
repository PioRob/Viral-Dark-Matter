% of the For Each Subsystem. In this demo the operations are
% performed on matrices.

% Open the demo model <matlab:open_system('sldemo_foreach_tiled')
% |sldemo_foreach_tiled|>. This model contains a For Each Subsystem 
% that processes submatrices of a matrix input signal.
%
% To process submatrices of a matrix signal, you will need to use nested 
% For Each Subsystems. The outer subsystem can be used to partition the 
% signal along the first dimension, while the inner one can be used to
% partition along the second dimension. This order is arbitrary, and can
% be changed without affecting the result.
%
% In this example a [4x4] matrix is to be partitioned into [2x2] submatrices.
% The outer subsystem partitions the signal along the first dimension. The resulting subarrays
% are then partitioned by the inner subsystem along the second dimension. 
% Concatenation of the outputs respects the partitioning order to preserve the
% shape of the input signal. Note, however, that the output dimensions change since
% the processing of the submatrices results in scalar outputs.
%
% To see a tile repetition implementation for this model, double-click 
% on the subsystem in the left corner of the model window.
% This implementation does not use the For Each Subsystem. Instead, it mimics
% the functionality of the For Each Subsystem by replicating the subsystem as
% many times as necessary
% and by selecting and concatenating the signals appropriately. This
% replication process is prone to error and is not scalable- 
% changing the input signal size would require changing the model accordingly.
