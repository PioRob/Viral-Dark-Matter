%TIMES  Element-by-element multiplication of fi objects
%   C = TIMES(A,B) is the element-by-element product of A and B.
%   A and B must have the same dimensions unless one of them is a scalar.
%   A scalar can be multiplied into anything.
%   C = TIMES(A,B) is called for the syntax A .* B when A or B is a fi 
%   object.
%   TIMES does not support fi objects of data type boolean.
