%% Modeling a PWM Driven Hydraulic Servomechanism
% 
% This demo uses Simulink(R) and Stateflow(R) to model a hydraulic
% servomechanism controlled by a pulse-width modulated (PWM) solenoid. This
% type of motion control system is used in industrial, manufacturing,
% automotive and aerospace applications.
%
% In this demo, nonlinear differential equations are used to model the
% magnetic, hydraulic and mechanical components of the system.
% Discrete-time difference equations are used to represent the controller.
% A behavioral model in Stateflow implements the electronic circuit
% generating the PWM waveforms and regulating the solenoid current. Figure
% 1 shows a schematic of this mechanism.

%
% *Figure 1:* Schematic diagram of the Solenoid valve and hydraulic
% actuator
%
% * *Note*: This is a basic hydraulics demo. You can more easily build
% hydraulic models using Simscape(TM) and SimHydraulics(R). SimHydraulics
% extends Simulink with tools for modeling and simulating hydraulic power
% and control systems. It enables you to describe multi-domain systems
% containing connected hydraulic and mechanical components as physical
% networks.
%
%
%% Modeling the System Using Nonlinear Differential Equations
%
% The model of the servomechanism valve is divided in four parts:
%
% * Magnetic Circuit
% * Solenoid Armature Motion
% * Hydraulic System
% * Piston Motion
%
% *Magnetic Circuit*
%
% Consider first the magnetic circuit. The derivative of the magnetic flux
% is determined by Faraday's law as:
%
% $$\frac{d \phi}{d t} = \frac{v_{sol}- i R}{N}$$
%
% where $v_{sol}$ is the solenoid voltage, $i$ is the current, $R$ is the
% winding resistance and $N$ the number of turns. This equation assumes
% that fringing and leakage flux are negligible, as are eddy currents.
%
% We assume that the cross-sectional area of the air gap $A$ which relates
% the flux $\phi$ and the flux density $B$ at the air gap applies
% uniformly for the steel path so that:
%
% $$B = \frac{\phi}{A}$$
%
% The flux density is linked to the magnetic field intensity in the air and
% the steel. In the air, magnetic field intensity is computed by:
%
% $$H_{air} = \frac{B}{\mu_0}$$
%
% where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of air. In the steel, the magnetic
% field intensity $H_{steel}$ is linked to the flux density $B$ through a
% nonlinear function so that:
%
% $$H_{steel} = f(B)$$
%
% Note that the hysteresis is not modeled in this demo. The combination of
% the magnetic fields in the air and the steel gives us the magnetomotive
% force:
%
% $$MMF = H_{air} g + H_{steel} L_{steel}$$
%
% where $g$ is the length of the air gap and $L_{steel}$ is the length of the 
% steel magnetic circuit. 
%
% One last equation is now required to close the loop and obtain the
% current $i$ in the magnetic circuit by:
%
% $$i = \frac{MMF}{N}$$
%
% On the mechanical side, the force developed by the solenoid is computed
% as:
%
% $$F_{sol} = \frac{A B^2}{2 \mu_0}$$
%
% Implemented in Simulink, magnetic circuit equations look like:

% *Figure 2:* Solenoid magnetic circuit subsystem
%
% *Solenoid Armature Motion*
%
% The motion of the solenoid moving part, the armature, is generated by a
% combination of magnetic, hydraulic and mechanical forces:
% 
% $$ m \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = F_{sol} + A_0 P_s - F_{s0} - K_s x - C_v x\cdot$$
% 
% where $A_0$ is the supply orifice area, $P_s$ is the hydraulic circuit
% supply pressure, $F_{s0}$ is the spring preload, $K_s$ is the return spring
% rate and $C_v$ is the damping rate.
%
% In Simulink this equation is implemented using the Second-Order
% Integrator block as show on figure 3.

%%
% *Figure 3:* Armature motion subsystem
%
%
% *Hydraulic Circuit*
%
% The flow in the hydraulic circuit is controlled by the motion of the
% solenoid armature. A schematic of this system is displayed in the
% following diagram
%
% <<sf_electrohydraulic_Solenoid.png>>
%
% *Figure 4:* Solenoid Schematic
%
% This diagram shows that when no current is applied to the magnetic
% circuit, the internal spring pushes the armature and ball to block the
% supply pressure $P_s$. When the supply pressure $P_s$ is blocked, the
% control pressure $P_c$ is directed toward the exhaust. When the solenoid
% is energized, the armature and pole come together and the supply pressure
% $P_s$ pushes the ball to open the supply port and block the exhaust port.
%
% The oil flow directed from the supply system to the piston, $q_{net}$, is
% the combination of the supply flow and the exhaust flow.
%
% $$ q_{net} = q_{s} - q_{ex} $$
%
% The supply flow is computed has:
%
% $$ q_{s} = K_0 A_0 sgn(P_s - p_c) \sqrt{|P_s-p_c|}$$
%
% where $p_c$ is the control pressure and $K_0$ is the flow coefficient.
% The exhaust flow is computed has
%
% $$ q_{ex} = K_0 A_0 \sqrt{p_c} $$
%
% In Simulink, the supply and exhaust equations are implemented using If
% Action Subsystems. These subsystems are activated based on the armature
% position.

%
% To complete the hydraulic circuit, the control pressure must be computed.
% This pressure is a function of the net oil flow in the circuit $q_{net}$
% and the piston position $x_p$ as:
%
% $$\frac{d p_c}{d t} = \frac{\beta}{x_p A_p}(q_{net} - \frac{d x_p}{d t} A_p)$$
%
% where $\beta$ is the oil bulk modulus and $A_p$ is the cross-sectional
% area of the cylinder.

%%
% *Figure 7:* Cylinder Pressurization Subsystem
%
% *Piston Motion*
%
% The piston's equation of motion is:
%
% $$M_p \frac{d x^2}{d t} = p_p A_p - K_{sp} x_p $$
%
% where $M_p$ is the net actuator mass and $k_{sp}$ is the spring rate.
%
% In Simulink this equation is implemented using the Second-Order
% Integrator block as:

open_system('sf_electrohydraulic/Piston Motion');

%%
close_system('sf_electrohydraulic',0);

%%
% *Figure 8:* Piston Motion Subsystem
%
%
%% Implementing the Controller Using Discrete-Time Difference Equations 
%
% The objective of the system is to position the load $x_p$ so that it
% follows a time-varying set point $r_{set}$. An electronic controller
% compares the command and set point to generate a PWM control signal at a
% rate of 50 Hz. We employ a discrete-time PI control law:
%
% $$dutycycle = (K_p + \frac{K_I}{z-1})(r_{set}-x_p)$$
%
% The control signal is applied to a 50 Hz pulse train and the power electronics 
% converts the pulse signal to the solenoid current.
%
%% Implementing the Behavioral Model of a PWM Generating Circuit Using Stateflow
%
% Digital and analog integrated circuits are available to perform this
% function, so we use a behavioral model rather than a highly detailed
% physical model. The behavior is best described in terms of the circuit's
% reaction to the commands and the response of it's load. The voltage and 
% current for one typical cycle of the control circuit show in figure 9.
%
% <<sf_electrohydraulic_PWM.png>>
%
% *Figure 9:* Voltage and current behavior of the PWM signal within one
% pulse.
%
% At the beginning of each cycle, the PWM pulse turns on to push the
% armature against the pole and open the valve supplying pressure. At that
% time the driver circuit applies the full voltage to achieve the fastest
% initial rise in current. The solenoid maintains this condition until the
% current as risen to the level at which the magnetic and hydraulic forces
% overcome the spring and move the armature.
%
% Once the armature has been pulled in, the air gap is very small and less
% current is needed to hold the armature in place. The driver regulates the
% current at a lower level for the remainder of the "on" portion of the
% cycle.
%
% At the end of each pulse, the armature releases so that the ball returns
% to its original position to open the exhaust. This is achieved by opening
% the solenoid circuit so that the magnetic field collapses quickly. The
% current then remains at zero for the duration of the "off" time until the
% next cycle begins.
%
%
% This way, the "on" portion of the PWM cycle is composed of the "pull in" 
% and "hold". The "off" portion is characterized by the initial rapid decay, 
% followed by zero voltage and current.  
%
% This can be implemented in Stateflow as:
%

%%
open_system('sf_electrohydraulic', 'loadonly');
rt = sfroot;
machine = rt.find('-isa','Stateflow.Machine','Name','sf_electrohydraulic');
PWM_Driver_Circuit_Chart = machine.find('-isa','Stateflow.Chart','Name','PWM Driver Circuit');
PWM_Driver_Circuit_Chart.visible = 1;
