%% Manipulator with SpaceMouse
% 
% This example illustrates the use of Simulink(R) 3D Animation(TM) for virtual reality prototyping 
% and testing the viability of designs before the implementation phase. Also, this example 
% illustrates the use of the Magellan SpaceMouse for manipulating objects in a virtual world.

% 
% The VRML model represents a nuclear hot chamber manipulator. It is manipulated 
% by a simple Simulink(R) model containing the SpaceMouse Input block. 
% This model uses all 6 degrees of freedom of the SpaceMouse for manipulating 
% the mechanic arm, and mouse button 1 to close the grip of manipulator jaws.
% 
% Magellan Space Mouse is an input device with 6 degrees of freedom. 
% It is useful for navigating and manipulating objects in a virtual world. 
% SpaceMouse is also suitable as a general input device for Simulink models. 
% This professional 3-D device greatly facilitates all the above mentioned tasks, 
% and we recommend you use it for higher performance applications and user comfort. 
% SpaceMouse is supported through the SpaceMouse Input block which is included 
% in the Simulink 3D Animation block library.
% 
% The Magellan SpaceMouse Input block can operate in three modes to cover the most 
% typical use of such a device in 3-D context:
% 
%  * Speeds
%  * Positions
%  * Viewpoint coordinates
% 
% Note: This demo requires the SpaceMouse or compatible device (SpaceMouse Plus, SpaceTraveller, PuckMan).
