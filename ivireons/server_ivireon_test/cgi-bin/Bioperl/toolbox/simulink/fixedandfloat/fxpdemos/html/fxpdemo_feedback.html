% Upon opening, this model launches the Fixed-Point Tool.  The tool is a graphical user interface (GUI) that
% automates common tasks of collecting min-max range data during simulations for use in automatically
% selecting fixed-point scaling for blocks.  You can configure any fixed-point capable block in Simulink(R) to accept
% the scaling proposed by the tool.  You can manually specify scaling for key blocks such as input ports and
% selectively disable automated scaling in a model on a block-by-block basis.  This gives the Fixed-Point Tool more
% information to work with and results in automatically selected fixed-point scalings that are compatible with the
% key manually selected scalings.
