%% Block Priority
% 
% This demonstration shows what happens when blocks are assigned different
% priorities.  The block priority affects the order in which the blocks are
% executed.  You can set the block priority through the Block Properties dialog.
% 
% The block sorting order is calculated only at the beginning of a
% simulation.  For this reason, changes to a block's Priority property are only
% updated when the simulation is started.  Double click on the green block
% to change the priority levels for the blocks and see what happens.
% 
% Inside of each triggered subsystem is an S-Function which controls the coloring 
% of the blocks and also slows down the simulation. The priority level of the block 
% is displayed using the format attribute string that can be set in the Block Properties 
% dialog.
