%% Tic-Tac-Flow : Model of a Hand-held Game
% 
% This is a variation of the classic tic-tac-toe game with an interesting
% twist. Only the last three moves of each player count. Thus the user
% needs to also account for the order in which the opponent has played the
% last few moves. This adds a nontrivial twist to the gameplay.
% 
% The model demonstrates several Stateflow(R) charts interacting with each
% other.  It exhibits how heavily event based logic can be captured
% naturally in Stateflow.  It also describes Stateflow semantics such as
% parallel substates, graphical functions and MATLAB(R) handle graphics from
% Stateflow. The model is divided into several subsystems which naturally
% separate the game control from the I/O. This allows for the Stateflow
% code generated from the game control chart to be reused easily in a
% hardware component.

% The GUI is implemented as a MATLAB figure which interacts with the
% Stateflow simulation. The button callback functions drive the inputs to
% the Stateflow chart.


% for now let us completely bypass the entire simulation just to get the
% pretty pictures to appear.
