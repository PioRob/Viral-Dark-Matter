function result = clearAndSetBreakpointsForFile(filename, requestedBreakpoints)
%syncbreakpoints is a bridge between the Java breakpoints display and MATLAB
%   This function clears the breakpoints for the given file, and then
%   installs the given breakpoints, which should all be breakpoints for the
%   given file.
%
%   If errors occur during the clearing of breakpoints, they will be
%   quietly ignored.
%
%   If the following errors occur during the breakpoint installation
%   process, they will be quietly ignored:
%
%       * MATLAB:lineBeyondFileEnd
%       * MATLAB:no_anonymous_function_on_line
%       * MATLAB:not_enough_anonymous_functions_on_line
%
%   All other errors will result in a dialog with the exception message
%   being shown, and that exception message will be returned to the caller
%   to indicate a failure.
%
%   This function is unsupported and might change or be removed without
%   notice in a future version. 

%   result = clearAndSetBreakpointsForFile(filename, requestedBreakpoints)
