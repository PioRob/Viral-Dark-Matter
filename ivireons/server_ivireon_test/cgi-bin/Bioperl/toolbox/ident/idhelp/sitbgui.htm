<TITLE> System Identification Process</TITLE>
<center><h3>System Identification Process</h3></center><p>
System identification is the art and science of building mathematical models
from measured input-output data. <p>
First, you import and examine the measured data. If necessary, you create new data sets from the original 
one by preparing the data for estimation (or preprocessing). For example, you can filter, resample, or transform the data. <P>

Then, you estimate models using the data. The models are estimated within certain
classes of candidate descriptions (or model structures) - typically, by choosing the model
that gives the best output fit to the measured data. It is common for several models to be 
estimated and their properties are analyzed by generating various Model Views.<p>

The process of system identification with GUI involves the following six steps:

<br> <A href="idimp.htm#data">Importing</a> data into the GUI.
<br> <A HREF="#dvieww">Examining</A> the data 
<br> <A HREF="iddatprp.htm">Preprocessing</A> data (or preparing the data for estimation)
<br> <A HREF="idestm.htm">Estimating models</A> based on the data 
<br> <A HREF="#mvieww">Analyzing the models</A>
<br> <A HREF="idmw.htm#export">Exporting</a> resulting models to the MATLAB workspace
    <p>
    
    <A HREF="idmw.htm">System Identification Tool (ident)</A> is a graphical user interface to the System Identification Toolbox,
    where you perform the various data processing, model estimation, and model analysis tasks. The GUI organizes the
    data sets and models used in a particular session, represented by rectangular icons. Data sets are shown in the 
    Data Board on the left, and models are shown in the Model Board on the right.<p>

    <TITLE>Data and Model Views</TITLE>
    <A NAME="vieww">
    <center><h3>Data and Model Views</h3></center><p>
    You can generate different views of the selected data and models from the GUI. 
    A selected data set or <a href="idmw.htm#datamod">selected models</a> has a
    thick line in the icon. To clear a selection, click that icon.<p>
    
    To restore the full range of the plots (for both data or model views), select 
    <b>Options->Autorange</b> in the Views window (or Ctrl+A).<p>
        
        
    <b>For data sets:</b><p>
    The <a href="#dvieww">Data Views</a> provide time- and frequency-domain plots of the
    input-output data. To create a <b>Time Plot</b>, <b>Data Spectra</b>, or <b>Frequency Function</b> for a specific data set,
    select the corresponding check box in the Data Views area of the GUI.<p>
    
    <b>For models:</b><p>
    The <a href="#mvieww">Model Views</a> analyze and display several model properties.
    To create a <b>Model Output</b>, <b>Model Residuals</b>, <b>Transient Response</b>, 
    <b>Frequency Response</b>, <b>Zeroes and Poles</b>, or <b>Noise Spectrum</b> for a specific model,
    select the corresponding check box in the Model Views area of the GUI. For nonlinear models, two
    nonlinearity plots are available: <b>Nonlinear ARX</b> and <b> Hamm-Wiener</b>. 
    These plots facilitate exploration of the nonlinearities. Note that zero-pole plot, frequency 
    response plot and noise spectrum plot do not apply to nonlinear models.<p>
    
    On color screens, the curves are color-coded to have the same colors as their associated icons in the GUI's data and model boards.<p>

        <center><h3>Data-View Windows</h3></center><p>
        There are three views for examining data sets. You can generate these views for selected data sets by selecting the 
        the corresponding check box in the Data Views area of the GUI.  To select the data sets you want to include
        in the plot, click their rectangular icons in the Data Board.<p>
        <dl>
        <dt> <b><A href="idplot.htm">Time Plot </A></b>
        <dd> Time plot of the inputs and outputs of the selected data sets
    <dt> <b><a href="iduyspe.htm">Data spectra </A></b>
    <dd> Spectral plot (periodogram or estimated spectrum) of inputs and 
    outputs of the selected data sets
<dt> <b><a href="idyuff.htm">Frequency function</A></b>
<dd>A plot of estimated frequency functions (estimated using ETFE for
time- and frequency-domain data) of the selected data sets

<TITLE>Model View Windows</TITLE>
<A NAME="mvieww">
<center><h3>Model View Windows</h3></center><p>
There are six views for examining models. You can generate these views for selected models by selecting the 
the corresponding check box in the Model Views area of the GUI.  To select the models you want to include
in the plot, click their icons in the Model Board(s).<p>
<dl>
    <dt> <b><a href="compare.htm">Model Output</a></b>
    <dd>Shows the simulated (or predicted) output of the selected
    models together with the measured output.

    validation data set</a>.
    <dt> <b><a href="resid.htm">Model Resids (or Residuals)</a></b>
    <dd>Shows the result of residual analysis for the each of the
    selected models. The residuals (prediction errors) are computed using
    the <a href="idmw.htm#workval">validation data set</a>, and then their 
    correlation functions are shown.
