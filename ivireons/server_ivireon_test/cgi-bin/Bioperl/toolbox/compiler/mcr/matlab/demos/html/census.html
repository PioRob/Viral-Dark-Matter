% Let's fit the data with a polynomial in t and use it to extrapolate to t =
% 2010.  The coefficients in the polynomial are obtained by solving a linear
% system of equations involving a 11-by-11 Vandermonde matrix, whose elements
% are powers of scaled time, A(i,j) = s(i)^(n-j);

n = length(t);
s = (t-1950)/50;
A = zeros(n);
A(:,end) = 1;
for j = n-1:-1:1, A(:,j) = s .* A(:,j+1); end

%%
% The coefficients c for a polynomial of degree d that fits the data p are
% obtained by solving a linear system of equations involving the last d+1
% columns of the Vandermonde matrix:
%    
%     A(:,n-d:n)*c ~= p
%
% If d is less than 10, there are more equations than unknowns and a least
% squares solution is appropriate.  If d is equal to 10, the equations can be
% solved exactly and the polynomial actually interpolates the data.  In either
% case, the system is solved with MATLAB's backslash operator.  Here are the
% coefficients for the cubic fit.
