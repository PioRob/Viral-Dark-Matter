%% Plane Take-Off with Trajectory Tracing
% 
% This model is a variant of the vrtkoff example that shows how to trace trajectory of
% a moving object (the plane) in the scene.
%   
% VR Tracer block adds the following behavior to the scene visualization:
% 
% A marker is placed at the current position of the traced object in regular time intervals 
% specified by the block sample time. Markers form a visible trace of the object's trajectory.
% The distance between markers indicates the speed of the object at given position.
% In addition, marker color can be dynamically set using the second block input to represent 
% another model property or status.
%  
% VR Tracer block allows you to specify the following parameters:
% 
% * Associated VRML File
% * Parent node of markers to create (useful when the traced object is inside other object in the scene hierarchy)
% * General marker shape to be selected from the listbox (select None for displaying line/triads below only)
% * Checkboxes to select whether you want to display trajectory as a line and/or axis-aligned triads
% * Marker scale
% * Marker color, to be defined in block input or in the block mask.
% * Sample time
% * Checkbox to ensure that a viewer window is open during simulation
% 
% In this example, a tetrahedron shape is used as a general shape marker,
% together with both trajectory line and triads.
