%FWRITE Write binary data to file.
%   COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A) writes the elements of matrix A to the
%   specified file. The data are written in column order. COUNT is 
%   the number of elements successfully written. 
%
%   FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN, or 1 for
%   standard output or 2 for standard error.
%
%   COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A,PRECISION) writes the elements of matrix A
%   to the specified file, translating MATLAB values to the specified
%   precision.
%
%   PRECISION controls the form and size of the result.  See the list
%   of allowed precisions under FREAD. If PRECISION is not specified, 
%   MATLAB uses the default, which is 'uint8'. If either 'bitN' or 
%   'ubitN' is used for the PRECISION then any out of range value of A 
%   is written as a value with all bits turned on. If the precision is 
%   'char' or 'char*1', MATLAB writes characters using the encoding 
%   scheme associated with the file. See FOPEN for more information.
%
%   COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A,PRECISION,SKIP) includes an optional SKIP
%   argument that specifies the number of bytes to skip before each
%   PRECISION value is written. With the SKIP argument present, FWRITE
%   skips and writes a value, skips and writes another value, etc.
%   until all of A is written.  If PRECISION is a bit format like
%   'bitN' or 'ubitN' SKIP is specified in bits. This is useful for
%   inserting data into noncontiguous fields in fixed length records.
%
%   COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A,PRECISION,SKIP,MACHINEFORMAT) treats the data 
%   written as having a format given by the string MACHINEFORMAT. You 
%   can obtain the MACHINEFORMAT argument from the output of the 
%   FOPEN function. See FOPEN for possible values for MACHINEFORMAT.
%   
%   For example,
%
%       fid = fopen('magic5.bin','wb')
%       fwrite(fid,magic(5),'integer*4')
%
%   creates a 100-byte binary file, containing the 25 elements of the
%   5-by-5 magic square, stored as 4-byte integers.
