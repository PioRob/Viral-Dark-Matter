%% Discretizing a Notch Filter
% While control system components are often designed in continuous time, 
% they must generally be discretized for implementation on digital
% computers and embedded processors. This demo compares several techniques
% for discretizing a notch filter.

%% Continuous-Time Notch Filter
% Notch filters are designed to reject signal content at a specific frequency by sharply
% attenuating the gain at that frequency. For this demo we consider the
% following notch filter:
%
% $$ H(s) = {s^2 + 0.5 s + 100 \over s^2 + 5 s + 100} $$
%
% You can plot the frequency response of this filter with the |bode|
% command:
H = tf([1 0.5 100],[1 5 100]);
bode(H), grid

%%
% This notch filter provides a 20dB attenuation at the frequency w = 1
% rad/s.

%% Choosing the Discretization Method
% You can discretize a continuous-time system with the |c2d| command.
% Several discretization algorithms are supported by Control System Toolbox(TM), including:
%
% * Zero-order hold
% * First-order hold
% * Impulse invariant
% * Tustin (bilinear approximation)
% * Tustin with frequency prewarping
% * Matched poles and zeros
%
% Which method to choose depends on the application and requirements.

%%
% The zero- and first-order
% hold methods and the impulse-invariant method are well-suited for discrete 
% approximations in the time domain. For example, the step response of the ZOH 
% discretization matches the continuous-time step response at each time step 
% (independently of the sampling rate):
Ts = 0.1;
Hdz = c2d(H,Ts,'zoh');
step(H,'b',Hdz,'r'),
legend('Continuous','Discretized at 10 Hz')

%% 
% Similarly, the impulse-invariant discretization has the same impulse
% response as the original system:
G = tf([1 -3],[1 2 10]);
Gd = c2d(G,Ts,'imp');
impulse(G,'b',Gd,'r')
legend('Continuous','Discretized at 10 Hz')

%%
% By contrast, the Tustin and Matched methods tend to perform better in the
% frequency domain because they introduce less gain and phase distortion near the Nyquist
% frequency. For example, compare the Bode responses of the continuous-time
% notch filter and its discretizations using the ZOH, Tustin, and Matched
% algorithms:
Hdt = c2d(H,Ts,'tustin');
Hdm = c2d(H,Ts,'match');
bode(H,'b',Hdz,'r',Hdt,'m',Hdm,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','ZOH','Tustin','Matched')

%% 
% This comparison indicates that the Matched method provides the most
% accurate frequency-domain approximation of the notch filter. However, you
% can further improve the accuracy of the Tustin algorithm by specifying a
% prewarping frequency equal to the notch frequency. This ensures accurate
% match near w = 10 rad/s:
Hdp = c2d(H,Ts,'prewarp',10);
bode(H,'b',Hdt,'m',Hdp,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','Tustin','Tustin with prewarping')


%% Choosing the Sampling Rate
% The higher the sampling rate, the closer the match between the
% continuous and discretized responses. But how small can the sampling 
% rate be, or equivalently, how large can the sampling interval be?
% As a rule of thumb, if you want the continuous and discretized models
% to match closely up to some frequency |wm|, make sure that the  
% Nyquist frequency (sampling rate times Pi) is at least twice |wm|.
% For the notch filter, you need to preserve 
% the shape near 10 rad/s, so the Nyquist frequency should be beyond 
% 20 rad/s, which gives a sampling period of at most pi/20 = 0.16 s. 
%
% To confirm this choice, compare the matched discretizations with sampling period
% 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3:
Hd1 = c2d(H,0.1,'m');
Hd2 = c2d(H,0.15,'m');
Hd3 = c2d(H,0.3,'m');
bode(H,'b',Hd1,'r',Hd2,'m',Hd3,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','Ts = 0.1','Ts = 0.15','Ts = 0.3')


%% 
% As predicted, the discretization remains fairly accurate for 
% |Ts < 0.16| but starts breaking down for larger sampling intervals.

%% Interactive GUI
% Click on the link below to launch an interactive GUI that further 
% demonstrates how the discretized notch filter is affected by 
% the choice of discretization algorithm and sampling rate.
