%% Interpolation Algorithm Selection and Trajectory Animation
% 
% This model employs a dynamic comet plot to visualize the result of changing
% the interpolation and extrapolation options for a 2-D data set running in a
% Lookup Table n-D block.  Algorithm options can be employed in different 
% situations to tradeoff accuracy, smoothness, data size, and performance.
% 
% Try opening the model and using the lookup table block's dialog to
% change the interpolation and extrapolation algorithms. A copy of the
% dialog is embedded in the right hand pane in the  Model Explorer and 
% will show up after the first simulation.  The Model Explorer is a 
% new component in Simulink(R) 6.0.  You can enter and tweak values for 
% the entire model and its blocks from the Model Explorer, including settings 
% for model configuration parameters, Simulink blocks, Stateflow(R) charts, and 
% Real-Time Workshop(R) settings for code generation and data management.

% To make the plot, data from the simulation is logged using the non-intrusive
% logging features in Simulink 6.0.  Non-intrusive logging is annotated on the 
% block diagram by the small blue "transmitter antennas" on certain block output
% ports. These logging points can be set from the MATLAB(R) command line using
% set_param(), or via the Signal & Scope Manager from the Tools menu or the signal
% properties dialog.
