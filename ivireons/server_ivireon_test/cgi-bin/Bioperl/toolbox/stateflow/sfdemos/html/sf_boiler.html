% The Stateflow chart controls when the boiler is turned on and off.
% Initially, the boiler is turned off through the use of the turn_boiler
% graphical function.  Every 5 seconds, the boiler's LED flashes, again
% through the use of a graphical function.  After 40 seconds, if the boiler
% is cold, the boiler is turned on.  After 20 seconds, the boiler is turned
% off once again, and the cycle repeats. 
% 

open_system([mdl, '/Bang-Bang Controller']);

%%
% Note the use of absolute time temporal logic to control the transition
% between the states and to periodically flash the LED. The syntax 
% |after(20,sec)| means take the transition 20 seconds after the state was
% entered. Note that the chart does not have an input event called |sec|.
% |sec| is a keyword which can be used in temporal logic operators to
% specify delay in terms of simulation time rather than occurrences of
% events.
% 
% Since we cannot use the |every| temporal logic operator with the |sec|
% keyword, we use a "workaround" which involves an inner substate called
% |Flash| with a self-transition triggered by the condition |after(5,sec)|.
% This means that the entry action of the |Flash| substate is performed
% every 5 seconds.

%% Simulation Results
% Looking at the Simulink scope, we can see that after approximately 450
% seconds, the boiler temperature is effectively maintained at the set
% temperature of 20 degrees Celsius.
