%% Modeling an Anti-Lock Braking System
%
% This demo describes a simple model for an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS). It
% simulates the dynamic behavior of a vehicle under hard braking conditions. The
% model represents a single wheel, which may be replicated a number of times to
% create a model for a multi-wheel vehicle.
%
% This model uses the signal logging feature in Simulink(R). The model logs signals
% to the MATLAB(R) workspace where you can analyze and view them. You can
% <matlab:edit('sldemo_absbrakeplots.m') view the code> in
% |sldemo_absbrakeplots.m| to see how this is done.
%
% In this model, the wheel speed is calculated in a separate model named
% |sldemo_wheelspeed_absbrake.mdl|.  This component is then referenced using a 'Model'
% block.  Note that both the top model and the referenced model use a variable
% step solver, so Simulink will track zero-crossings in the referenced model.

%% Analysis and Physics
%
% The wheel rotates with an initial angular speed that corresponds to the
% vehicle speed before the brakes are applied. We used separate integrators to
% compute wheel angular speed and vehicle speed. We use two speeds to calculate
% slip, which is determined by Equation 1. Note that we introduce vehicle speed
% expressed as an angular velocity (see below).
% 
% $$\omega_v = \frac{V}{R} \mbox{ (equals the wheel angular speed if there is no slip)}$$

%%
% *Equation 1*
%
% $$ \omega_v = \frac{V_v}{R_r}$$
%
% $$slip=1-\frac{\omega_w}{\omega_v}$$
%
% $$\omega_v = \mbox{ vehicle speed divided by wheel radius}$$
%
% $$ V_v = \mbox{ vehicle linear velocity}$$
%
% $$ R_r = \mbox{ wheel radius}$$
%
% $$ \omega_w = \mbox{ wheel angular velocity}$$

%%
%
% From these expressions, we see that slip is zero when wheel speed and vehicle
% speed are equal, and slip equals one when the wheel is locked. A desirable
% slip value is |0.2|, which means that the number of wheel revolutions equals
% |0.8| times the number of revolutions under non-braking conditions with the
% same vehicle velocity.  This maximizes the adhesion between the tire and road
% and minimizes the stopping distance with the available friction.

%% Modeling
%
% The friction coefficient between the tire and the road surface, |mu|, is an
% empirical function of slip, known as the mu-slip curve. We created mu-slip
% curves by passing MATLAB variables into the block diagram using a Simulink
% lookup table. The model multiplies the friction coefficient, |mu|, by the
% weight on the wheel, |W|, to yield the frictional force, |Ff|, acting on the
% circumference of the tire.  |Ff| is divided by the vehicle mass to produce the
% vehicle deceleration, which the model integrates to obtain vehicle velocity.
%
% In this model, we used
% an ideal anti-lock braking controller, that uses 'bang-bang' control based
% upon the error between actual slip and desired slip. We set the desired
% slip to the value of slip at which the mu-slip curve reaches a peak value,
% this being the optimum value for minimum braking distance (see note below.). 
%
% * Note: In an actual vehicle, the slip cannot be measured directly, so this control
% algorithm is not practical. It is used in this example to illustrate the
% conceptual construction of such a simulation model. The real engineering
% value of a simulation like this is to demonstrate the potential of the
% control concept prior to addressing the specific issues of implementation. 
%

%% Creating a Temporary Directory for the Demo
%
% During this demonstration, Simulink generates files in the current 
% working directory. If you do not want to generate files in this 
% directory, change the working directory to a suitable directory:

newdir = tempname; %code not shown in demo HTML, move to temp directory
mkdir(newdir);
origdir = cd(newdir);

%%
% 
%  origdir = cd(tempdir);
% 
%% Opening the Model
%
% To <matlab:open_system('sldemo_absbrake') open this model> type
% |sldemo_absbrake| in MATLAB terminal (or click on the hyperlink if you are
% using MATLAB Help).

open_system('sldemo_absbrake'); % this code is not shown in the demo

%%
% *Figure 1:* Anti-Lock Braking (ABS) Model

%% 
%
% Double click on the 'Wheel Speed' subsystem in the model window to open
% it. Given the wheel slip, the desired wheel slip, and the tire torque, this
% subsystem calculates the wheel angular speed.

open_system('sldemo_absbrake/Wheel Speed');

%%
% *Figure 2:* Wheel Speed subsystem

%%
%
% To control the rate of change of brake pressure, the model subtracts
% actual slip from the desired slip and feeds this signal into a bang-bang
% control (|+1| or |-1|, depending on the sign of the error, see Figure 2). This on/off
% rate passes through a first-order lag that represents the delay associated
% with the hydraulic lines of the brake system. The model then integrates
% the filtered rate to yield the actual brake pressure. The resulting
% signal, multiplied by the piston area and radius with respect to the
% wheel (|Kf|), is the brake torque applied to the wheel. 
%
% The model multiplies the frictional force on the wheel by the wheel
% radius (|Rr|) to give the accelerating torque of the road surface on the
% wheel. The brake 
% torque is subtracted to give the net torque on the wheel. Dividing the
% net torque by the wheel rotational inertia, |I|, yields the wheel
% acceleration, which is then integrated to provide wheel velocity. In
% order to keep the wheel speed and vehicle speed positive,
% limited integrators are used in this model.      

%% Running the Simulation in ABS Mode
%
% Press the "Play" button on the model toolbar to run the simulation. You
% can also run the simulation by executing the |sim('sldemo_absbrake')|
% command in MATLAB. ABS is turned on during this simulation.    

evalc('sim(''sldemo_absbrake'')'); %this code is not shown in the demo

%%
% *Figure 3:* Baseline Simulation Results

%%
%
% * Note: The model logs relevant data to MATLAB
% workspace in a structure called |sldemo_absbrake_output|. Logged signals have a blue indicator. In this case |yout| and |slp| are logged
% (<matlab:open_system('sldemo_absbrake') see the model>).  Read more about
% Signal Logging in Simulink Help.

Time_ABS = sldemo_absbrake_output.yout.Sd.Time; % Save the ABS results
Stop_ABS = sldemo_absbrake_output.yout.Sd.Data;

%% 
%
% Figure 3 visualizes the ABS simulation results (for default parameters). The
% first plot in Figure 3 shows the wheel angular velocity and corresponding
% vehicle angular velocity. This plot shows that the wheel speed stays below
% vehicle speed without locking up, with vehicle speed going to zero in less
% than 15 seconds.
%

%% Running the Simulation without ABS
%
% For more meaningful results, consider the vehicle behavior without
% ABS. At the MATLAB command line, set the model variable |ctrl = 0|.  This
% disconnects the slip feedback from the controller (see Figure 1), resulting in
% maximum braking. The results are shown in Figure 4.
%
%  ctrl = 0;

ctrl=0;

%%
%
% Now run the simulation again. This will model braking without ABS. 

evalc('sim(''sldemo_absbrake'')'); %this code is not shown in the demo

%% 
% *Figure 4:* Maximum braking simulation results (braking without ABS)

Time_no_ABS = sldemo_absbrake_output.yout.Sd.Time; %save the non-ABS results
Stop_no_ABS = sldemo_absbrake_output.yout.Sd.Data;

%% Braking With ABS versus Braking Without ABS
%
% In the upper plot of Figure 4, observe that the wheel locks up in about seven
% seconds. The braking, from that point on, is applied in a less-than-optimal
% part of the slip curve. That is, when |slip = 1|, as seen in the lower plot of
% Figure 4, the tire is skidding so much on the pavement that the friction force
% has dropped off.
% 
% This is, perhaps, more meaningful in terms of the comparison shown in Figure
% 5. The distance traveled by the vehicle is plotted for the two cases. Without
% ABS, the vehicle skids about an extra 100 feet, taking about three seconds
% longer to come to a stop.

%% Conclusions 
%
% This model demonstrates how you can use Simulink to simulate a braking
% system under the action of an ABS controller. The controller in this
% example is idealized, but you can use any proposed control algorithm in
% its place to evaluate the system's performance. You can also use the Real-Time Workshop(R)
% with Simulink as a valuable tool for rapid prototyping of the
% proposed algorithm. C code is generated and compiled for the controller
% hardware to test the concept in a vehicle. This significantly reduces the
% time needed to prove new ideas by enabling actual testing early in
% the development cycle. 
%
% For a hardware-in-the-loop braking system
% simulation, you can remove the 'bang-bang' controller and run the
% equations of motion on real-time hardware to emulate the wheel and
% vehicle dynamics. You can do this by generating real-time C code for
% this model using the Real-Time Workshop. You can then test an actual ABS
% controller by interfacing it to the real-time time hardware, which 
% runs the generated code. In this scenario, the real-time model would send
% the wheel speed to the controller, and the controller would send brake
% action to the model.
