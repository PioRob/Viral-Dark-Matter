%% Variable-Size Signal Basic Operations
% The purpose of this demo is to introduce you to the basic 
% operations associated with variable-size signals. The following
% model shows you how to generate variable-size signals, and some
% of the operations that you can apply to them.

%% About This Demo 
% Open the demo model <matlab:open_system('sldemo_varsize_basic')
% |sldemo_varsize_basic|>. This model contains several blocks that support
% variable-size signals.
%
% Common ways of generating variable-size signals are:
%
% * Use a Switch block with a different size signal at each input port.
% * Use a Selector block  and allow the size selection index to change over time.
%
% Eighty blocks can operate with variable-size signals including the
% Gain block, the Sum block, the Math Function block, the Matrix 
% Concatenate block, and the Bus Creator block. In addition, you can
% probe variable-size signals using the Width or the Probe block, 
% display variable-size signals on Scope blocks and save variable-size
% signals to the workspace using the To Workspace block. 
%
% For a complete list of blocks that support variable-size signals, 
% see "Simulink(R) Block Support for Variable-Size Signals" in the
% Simulink documentation.

model = 'sldemo_varsize_basic';
