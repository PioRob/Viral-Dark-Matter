%% Modeling a Rectifier With Zero Crossings
% 
% This is a simple model of a rectifier which takes a single (scalar) input
% and converts it into its absolute value. This simple model illustrates
% the zero crossings capability of Stateflow(R) (a new feature in R2007b).

mdl = 'sf_abs';
open_system(mdl);
close_system([mdl '/Scope']);

root = sfroot;
chart = root.find('-isa', 'Stateflow.Chart', 'Name', 'AbsoluteValue');
chart.visible = 0;

%% 
%
% The chart itself is simple. It has two states namely |P| (for positive
% input) and |N| (for negative input). This can readily seen to be the
% state machine of a rectifier.

chart.visible = 1;

%% 
% 
% The interesting thing about this model is the behavior of the Stateflow
% chart in the presence of variable step solvers (such as ode45). In this
% case, Stateflow registers a change in its state configuration with the
% Simulink(R) solver. This enables mode-changes to be recorded very
% accurately during simulation.
% 
% In order to enable this feature, you need to set the "Update Method"
% property of the Stateflow chart to be "continuous". When this is done, a
% new option called "Enable zero-crossing detection" is visible. This
% setting controls whether Stateflow will register a zero crossings signal
% with Simulink's solver. 

open_system([mdl '/Scope']);
evalc('sim(mdl)');

%% 
% 
% The fact that we recorded changes in mode accurately is evident when we
% plot the time intervals between successive "major time steps". When we do
% this, we see:

dt = [diff(tout); NaN];
plot(tout, dt);
xlabel('Simulation time (t)');
ylabel('Simulation time step (dt = diff(t))');

%% 
% 
% As is clear, the solver records six zero crossings corresponding to the
% six times when the sine wave changes sign.
