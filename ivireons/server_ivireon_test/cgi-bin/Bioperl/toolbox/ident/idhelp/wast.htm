<title>Trash Can</title>
In the ident window, you can remove data and models from the workspace by dragging them 
into the Trash icon. All associated plots are also deleted.<p>
If you want to restore any of the removed data or models to the workspace, double-click on the Trash icon in the
ident window to open the Trash dialog. Then, drag and drop the icons from the Trash dialog to the data or model
placeholders in the ident window.<p>
To permanently delete data in the Trash, click <b>Empty</b> in the Trash dialog. 
This is equivalent to selecting <b>Options->Empty trash</b> in the ident window.
<p>
The Trash is emptied automatically when you exit the System Identification Tool by
selecting <b>File->Close</b> in the main GUI window.<p>
