<title>Help: Nonlinear ARX Model Plot</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Nonlinear ARX Model Plot</h3></center>

<p>The Nonlinear ARX plot is opened by checking the
corresponding check box in the System Identification Tool window.</p>

<p>The plot shows the value of the model nonlinearity as a
function of input regressors. There are separate nonlinearities for each
output, and the nonlinearity for only one output is shown at a time. Choose the
output channel for which the nonlinear plot should be shown from the pop up
menu at the top of the plot window. </p>

<p>Use Style menu to enable 3D rotation on 3-dimensionsl plots
and use the Zoom option to enable zooming functionality on 2-dimensional plots.
The number of grid points used for shown plot can be modified by using the "Set
number of samples..." option from the Options menu.</p>

<p>Note: The plot shows the value of the nonlinearity as a
function of one or two regressors. Since a model may have more than two
regressors, the values of the regressors not chosen for the plot are fixed to
constant values. The selection of the regressors to use in the plot and the
allocation of fixed values for the other regressors can be done from the
control panel that appears on the right side of the plot axes. </p>
