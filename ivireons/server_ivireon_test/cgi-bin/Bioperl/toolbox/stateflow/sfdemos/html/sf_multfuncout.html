% 
% The main purpose of this demonstration is to illustrate the use of feedback
% when using function-call outputs. The 'Source' chart sends the signal
% 'out_fcn_two' when transition to from State A to State B or vice versa.
% 'out_fcn_two' activates 'Counter' every time it is sent out. 'Counter' also
% sends out a data output, 'out_one' which is fed back to 'Source' as data
% 'Input from Simulink(R)'. If the source is in State B, then a transition is
% taken from State B to State C if 'out_one' is greater than 10. If this
% transition is taken, then a new function-call event, 'out_fcn' is sent to
% the 'Delay' chart. The 'Delay' chart simply adds a 1 to its output,
% 'out_two' every time it is activated. In the output, 'Scope', notice that
% there is an initial delay that is the time it takes for the first 'out_fcn'
% to be sent.
