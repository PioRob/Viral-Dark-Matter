%% Temporal Logic Using the BEFORE Function
% 
% The BEFORE function allows you to execute a transition or an action before
% a certain number of events occur. In this example, we illustrate the use of
% the BEFORE function for three different conditions with three different
% constraints.
% 
% In superstate One, two conditions need to be met for the transition out of
% A_state: signal_one has to be less than 5 before 10 events occur. Since
% both these conditions are met, the output is set to 1 (after all three
% parallel states are initialized).
% 
% In superstate Two, two different conditions need to be met for the
% transition out of B_state: signal_two has to be greater than 10 before
% 20 events occur. These conditions are met later on in the simulation, when
% signal_two becomes greater than 10.
% 
% Finally, in superstate Three, two other conditions need to be met for the
% transition out of C_state: signal_three has to be greater than 11 before 10
% events occur. Since this never occurs, output3 is is never set to 1 and
% thus remains 0 for whole simulation.
