<title>Time Series and Spectra</title>
A <b>time series</b> is a measured "output" signal that does not have a known, measured input. 
A <b>multivariate</b> time series is a vector-valued signal.<p>
The analysis problem for time series and signals might be to investigate their frequency contents (spectra), and to 
build predictors for them.
A parametric model of a time series describes how it could be generated from a white noise source.<p>
When you import scalar and multivariate time series data by using the Import Data dialog, leave the Input field empty.<p>
To generate time series spectra, select the <b>Noise spectrum</b> check box under Model Views in the ident window.<p>
To compare the measured and predicted time series values, select the <b>Model output</b> check box under Model Views.<p>
