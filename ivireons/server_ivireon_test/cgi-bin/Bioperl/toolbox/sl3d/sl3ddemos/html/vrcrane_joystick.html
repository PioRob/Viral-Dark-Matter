%% Portal Crane with Joystick Control
% 
% The vrcrane_joystick example illustrates how a Simulink(R) model can interact with 
% a virtual world. The portal crane dynamics is modeled in Simulink and visualized 
% in virtual reality. The model uses Joystick Input block to control the setpoint. 
% Joystick 3 axes are used to control the setpoint position, button 1 is used to start the crane.
% 
% In order to minimize the number of signals transferred between the Simulink model 
% and the virtual reality world and to keep the model as simple and flexible as possible, 
% only the minimum set of moving objects properties are sent from the model to the 
% VR Sink block. All other values necessary for describing the virtual reality objects 
% movement are computed from this minimum set using VRMLScript written 
% in the associated VRML file.
% 
% For details on how the crane model hierarchy and scripting logic is implemented 
% please view the associated commented VRML file portal_crane.wrl in a text editor.
% 
% This example requires a standard Joystick with at least 3 independent axes 
% connected to the PC.
