%PRIVATECREATETIMESERIESCOLLECTION Create a time series collection from acquired data.
%
%    TSC = PRIVATECREATETIMESERIESCOLLECTION(OBJINFO, DATA, TIME, START, DAQEVENTS)
%    Creates a time series collection based on a data acquisition session 
%    described by OBJINFO, a structure with the scalar samplerate field, 
%    cell arrays containing fields channelnames (string) and channelunits (string)
%    (the physical units that the data is in), and a vector of hwids (integers), 
%    In addition, the function expects a matrix of data DATA, a vector of time
%    stamps, the absolute start time of START (t=0 in the TIME vector), and 
%    an array of data acquisition event structures, DAQEVENTS.  The
%    resulting time series in TSC will be in the 'seconds' time base, and
%    use a default interpolation method of zero order hold.
%

%    PRIVATECREATETIMESERIESCOLLECTION is a helper function for 
%    DAQREAD and GETDATA.  It is copied by the once stage make file to
%    matlab/toolbox/matlab/iofun/private so that it works in MATLAB when
%    Data Acquisition Toolbox is not installed.  Note that unlike DAQREAD,
%    a copy also remains in matlab/toolbox/daq/daq/private to support
%    GETDATA.
