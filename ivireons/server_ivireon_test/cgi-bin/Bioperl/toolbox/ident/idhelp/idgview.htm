To identify the name of the model or data corresponding to a curve, turn off the 
zoom  mode (using Style->Zoom option) and then click on the curve in the plot.<p>

To display a curve in the plot, click the corresponding data or model icon in the 
System Identification Tool window. For the data or model that is shown in the plot, 
the corresponding icon in the System Identification Tool window is marked by a 
thick line.
<p> To remove a curve from the plot, click the that data or model icon again.<p>

The color of a curve corresponds to the color of the data or model icon
in the System Identification Tool window. Note that the figures are opened with zoom 
mode enabled. You can disable the zoom model using the Style menu option for zoom control.<p>

For multi-input/multi-output data and models, choose the input-output pair by selecting it
from the <b>Channel</b> menu in the plot window.<hr>

<dt><b>Copy figure</b>
    <dd>Opens the plot as a MATLAB figure. Does not copy menus and controls.

 When zoom is enabled, right-click on a plot to zoom out and
 left-click on a plot to zoom in. When zoom is disabled, click any mouse button 
 on a plot to view the associated data or model name along with the values 
 of x and y coordinates corresponding to the location of the mouse on the curve.<p>
<b>Note:</b>To reset zoom after a plot is updated, select <b>Options->Autorange</b> in the plot window.<p>

 <dt><b>Separate linestyles</b> or <b>All solid lines</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive options determine how the curves appear on a plot. 
    On black and white monitors, use <b>Separate linestyles</b> to visually associate
    the curves with the data or model. The currently visible curves are assigned solid,
    dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted linestyles.

<title>Channel Menu in Plot Windows</title>
<a name="channel">
<center><h3>Channel Menu Items</h3></center><p>
Lists the available channels. The selected channel name is currently plotted.<p>
For example, u1->y2 means that the transfer function from input 'u1' to output 'y2' is displayed.
The symbol e (for example, used in e@y3->y1) represents a noise source. There are as many noise sources as outputs.
e@ynam refers to the innovation (noise source) for the output with name <tt>ynam</tt>.<p>
For the <b>Model output</b> and <b>Noise spectrum</b> Views, only the output name matters.<p>
The current channel names are always displayed in the figure title.<p>
The naming of the signals remains consistent among different data sets that
have been created by subselecting channels from an original set.
