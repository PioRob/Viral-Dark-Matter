% GETSTATESTRUCT Extract the state structure from an operating point
%
%   XSTRUCT = GETSTATESTRUCT(OP_POINT) extracts a structure of state values, 
%   XSTRUCT, from the operating point object, OP_POINT. The structure,
%   XSTRUCT, uses the same format as Simulink which allows you to set initial
%   values for states in the model within the Data Import/Export pane of the 
%   Configuration Parameters dialog box.
