% This demonstration illustrates how graphical functions can be used as
% recursive functions. The graphical function in the chart (called FACTORIAL)
% returns the factorial value of the input. This is possible because
% graphical functions can be called from within themselves or from within
% other graphical functions. The risk in using a recursive function, is the
% possibility of creating an infinite loop. In this example, FACTORIAL is
% called when the input value satisfies a certain condition. If the condition
% is not satisfied, another path within the function is taken and the output
% in this path is not dependent on the FACTORIAL function.
