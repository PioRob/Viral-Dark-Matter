You can load a saved <a href="#sess">session</a> by selecting its name from the
 <a href="idfile.htm"><b>File</b> menu</a>. <p>
 
To import a single data set directly from the MATLAB workspace,
do one of the following:
<ol>
<li> To create a data set from input and output signals available
 in the workspace, select 
 <dl><dt><b>Import data->Time domain data</b> 
 <dt>or
 <b>Import data->Frequency domain data</b>
 <dt>from the pop-up menu in the ident window.
 </dl>
 
 <li> If the data set already exists in the workspace as an IDDATA or IDFRD object, then
import it by selecting <dl><dt><b>Import data->Data Object</b></dl> 
</ol>
<b>Note:</b> Use the hot-key <b>d</b> to open the Import Data dialog when the ident window is in focus.<p>

In the Import Data dialog box, enter the appropriate information,
 such as the <b>Starting time</b> and the <b>Sampling interval</b>. Click the <b>More</b> button to
 display additional fields in the dialog, such as for entering <b>Notes</b>.<p>

<title> Ident Sessions </title>
<a name="sess">
<center><h3>Ident Sessions</h3></center><p>
A saved session stores the status of the data sets and models that are currently in the
Model and Data Board(s) - including their diary and notes. 
The session also includes an arbitrary number of additional boards
 (opened by selecting <b>Options->Extra model/data board</b> 
in the ident window).<p>

You open, manage, save and close sessions by selecting commands from the <b>File</b> menu in the ident window.<p>
Only one session can be open at any time. You can, however, merge a previously-saved session into the current one by
selecting <b>File->Merge session</b> from the menu.
