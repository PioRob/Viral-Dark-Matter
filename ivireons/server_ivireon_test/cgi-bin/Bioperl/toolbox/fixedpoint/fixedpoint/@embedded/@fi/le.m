%LE     Compare real-world value of two fi objects
%   C = LE(A,B) does an element-by-element comparison between A and B and
%   returns a matrix C of the same size with elements set to 1 where the 
%   relation (element of A less than or equal to the corresponding 
%   element of B) is true, and 0 where the relation is false. 
%   A and B must have the same dimensions unless one is a scalar. 
%   A scalar can be compared with another object of any size.
%   C = LE(A,B) is called for the syntax A <= B when A or B is a fi object.
