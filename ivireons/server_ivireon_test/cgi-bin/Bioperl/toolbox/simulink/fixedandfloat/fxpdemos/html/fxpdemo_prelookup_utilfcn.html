%% Shared Utility Functions for Prelookup Blocks
% The utility functions generated by the Prelookup block are determined by the target
% data type of the block's inputs, outputs, and breakpoint parameter, as well as the
% *Index search method* and *Integer rounding mode*. Even if the two Prelookup blocks
% in this model have different data types, they fullfill the above requirements and
% share their utility functions.
