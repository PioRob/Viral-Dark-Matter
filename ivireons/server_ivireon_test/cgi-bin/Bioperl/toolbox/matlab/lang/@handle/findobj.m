%FINDOBJ   Find objects matching specified conditions.
%   The FINDOBJ method of the HANDLE class follows the same syntax as the 
%   MATLAB FINDOBJ command, except that the first argument must be an array
%   of handles to objects.
%
%   HM = FINDOBJ(H, <conditions>) searches the handle object array H and 
%   returns an array of handle objects matching the specified conditions.
%   Only the public members of the objects of H are considered when 
%   evaluating the conditions.
