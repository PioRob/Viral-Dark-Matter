<title>Importing Time Domain Data</title>
<center><h3>Importing Time Domain Data</h3></center><p>

This dialog is used to import input and output signals into the System Identification Tool. The imported 
data is added to the Data Board in the ident window.<p>

<b>Data Format for Signals</b> pop-up menu options:<br>
By default, <b>Time-Domain Signals</b> is selected<p>

<b>Workspace Variable</b><br>
Enter valid MATLAB expressions in the <b>Input</b> and <b>Output</b> fields.  The 
expressions must evaluate to either a column vector or a matrix. For example,<p>
<tt> [temp(234:500) current(234:500).^2]</tt><p>
where <tt>temp</tt> and <tt>current</tt> are column vector variables 
in the MATLAB workspace.<p>

<b>Data Information</b><br>
<b>Data name</b> (Optional) Enter any string. The data set 
is labeled with this name in the ident window.<br>
<b>Starting time</b> and <b>Sampling interval</b> specify the time and frequency scales 
in the plot views.<p>
Click the <b>More</b> button to expand the dialog and specify the properties that 
associate the data with, <br>
<b>Channel Names</b> designate the individual channels in the input and output data. Enter the names without quotes and separated by commas. 
Default names for input channels are <tt>u1</tt>, <tt>u2</tt>,... (the maximum number of channels is specified by input dimensions).
Similarly, the output channels are named as <tt>y1</tt>, <tt>y2</tt>, .... The noise
sources are automatically named for the corresponding output:
<tt>e@yname</tt> is the name of the disturbance that is additive to the
output with channel name <tt>yname</tt>.<br>
The number of names must equal the number of channels.<p>  

<b>Physical Units of Variables</b> <br>
(Optional) Enter the units for the measured variables. These are used
only for plot information.<br>
Enter units as comma separated strings without quotes.<p>

<b>Notes</b> <br>
Enter any text that describes the data and the models.  The notes remain 
associated with the data and any models that are estimated from it.<p>

To hide the expanded pane, click <b>Less</b>. <p>
Click <b>Import</b> to import the data set. The data icon is added to the
 Data Board in the ident window.<p>
 
To restore all default values in this dialog, click <b>Reset</b>.<p>

<b>Note:</b> To import a variable from the MATLAB workspace in the
IDDATA format, select <b>Import data->Data object</b> from the pop-up menu to open the Import Data Object dialog. 
Or, type the hotkey <b>d</b> when the ident window is in focus.
