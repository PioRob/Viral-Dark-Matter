%% Customizing the Settings for the Demos in the Parallel Computing Toolbox(TM)
% This demo shows how to change the behavior of the demos in the Parallel Computing Toolbox(TM).
% There are at least two versions of each demo in the
% Parallel Computing Toolbox: a sequential version and a distributed version.
% The distributed versions will not run unless they can submit jobs to a
% scheduler, so the most important setting explained here is the configuration
% that the demos use to identify the scheduler to submit to.
%
% If you are not familiar with the concepts of distributed computing, please 
% read the documentation for the Parallel Computing Toolbox in the MATLAB(R) 
% help browser.

%% Accessing and Changing the Default Configuration
% The demos all use the default configuration when creating and submitting jobs.
% To be more specific, the demos use the scheduler identified by the default
% configuration.  You can either use the |Parallel| menu item in the menu bar
% to view and change the default configuration, or you can use the
% |defaultParallelConfig| function to get and set the default configuration:
defaultParallelConfig()
%%
% The 
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','distcomp','distcomp_ug.map'),'configurations_help')
% configurations documentation> 
% contains the complete guide to managing your configurations.
 
%% Accessing the Current Demo Settings
% All demo-related settings other than the default configuration can be obtained
% and changed via |paralleldemoconfig|.  Running the |paralleldemoconfig|
% command without any input arguments gives us a structure with the current demo
% settings.  We will examine these settings one at a time.  Any changes that we
% make to these settings remain in effect for the duration of the current MATLAB
% session.  If we want some changes to be applied every time MATLAB starts, we
% should put them into our |startup.m| file.  First, we look at the current
% settings:
orgconf = paralleldemoconfig()

%% Changing the Number of Tasks
% The number of tasks the demos create is stored in the |NumTasks| field.  We
% can change it to a different value by using paralleldemoconfig.
paralleldemoconfig('NumTasks', 3); % Use 3 tasks.

%% Changing the Demo Difficulty Level
% The total run time of most of the demos can be changed by a constant factor
% through the |Difficulty| field of |paralleldemoconfig|.  The default value is
% 1.0, and the demos attempt to adapt their problem sizes so that they run in 
% half the regular time when the |Difficulty| is set to 0.5 and twice the 
% regular time when the |Difficulty| is set to 2.0.  The |Difficulty| field
% can be set to any value greater than 0.

%%
% It should be noted that some of the demos perform a fixed amount of
% computation, therefore their run time cannot be controlled by the |Difficulty|
% field, and those demos issue a warning if they are run with a |Difficulty|
% value other than 1.0.  Let's see how the sequential blackjack demo responds 
% to changes in the difficulty level:
paralleldemoconfig('Difficulty', 0.5);
paralleldemo_blackjack_seq;

%%
% By looking at the graph of the total winnings, we can see how many people were
% playing in the simulation.  Observe that when we set the |Difficulty| field to
% 1.0, we simulate twice the number of players we simulated when using a
% difficulty level of 0.5.  Also notice that the Blackjack demo executes in half
% the time when run with |Difficulty| set to 0.5 when compared to the default
% value of 1.0.
paralleldemoconfig('Difficulty', 1.0);
paralleldemo_blackjack_seq;

%% Customizing the Network Directory 
% The |NetworkDir| field stores the name of a directory on a shared file system
% that the demos can use when they want to transfer input/output data between
% the client and the workers via the file system.  The directory is specified in
% two different formats, one for the Windows(R) platform and one for UNIX(R)
% platforms.  If our client and workers are only using one platform, we need to
% concern ourselves with only that field and we can safely ignore the other.
% Additionally, the directory permissions must be such that MATLAB can write to
% it, both from the client and the workers.

%%
% Assuming that the following two paths refer to the same directory on our
% file server, we can inform the Parallel Computing Toolbox of that
% correspondence:
pcdir = '\\mycomputer\user\subdir';
unixdir = '/home/user/subdir';
paralleldemoconfig('NetworkDir', struct('pc', pcdir, 'unix', unixdir));

%%
% Notice that we specified the Windows path as a UNC path and not in terms
% of mapped network drives.

%%
% If we do not have a shared network file system, we cannot run any of the
% demos that try to make use of it.  The same applies if there is no 
% directory that all the Windows machines recognize by one name and all
% the UNIX machines can recognize by another name.

%% Restoring the Original Settings
% We do not want this tutorial to change the default demo settings, so we
% restore their original values.
paralleldemoconfig(orgconf);
