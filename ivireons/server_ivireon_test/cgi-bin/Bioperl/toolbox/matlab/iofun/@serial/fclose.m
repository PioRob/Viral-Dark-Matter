function fclose(obj)
%FCLOSE Disconnect serial port object from device.
%
%   FCLOSE(OBJ) disconnects the serial port object, OBJ, from the 
%   device. OBJ can be an array of serial port objects.
%
%   If OBJ was successfully disconnected from the device, OBJ's
%   Status property is configured to closed and the RecordStatus 
%   property is configured to off. OBJ can be reconnected to the 
%   device with the FOPEN function.
%
%   You cannot disconnect an object while data is being written 
%   asynchronously to the device. The STOPASYNC function can be
%   used to stop an asynchronous write.
%
%   If OBJ is an array of serial port objects and one of the objects
%   cannot be disconnected from the device, the remaining objects  
%   in the array will be disconnected from the device and a warning
%   will be displayed.
%
%   Example:
%       s = serial('COM1');
%       fopen(s);
%       fprintf(s, '*IDN?');
%       idn = fscanf(s);
%       fclose(s);
%
