%GAMMALN Logarithm of gamma function.
%   Y = GAMMALN(X) computes the natural logarithm of the gamma function 
%   for each element of X.  GAMMALN is defined as LOG(GAMMA(X)) and 
%   is obtained without computing GAMMA(X).  Since the gamma function 
%   can range over very large or very small values, its logarithm is 
%   sometimes more useful.
%
%   Class support for input X:
%      float: double, single
%
