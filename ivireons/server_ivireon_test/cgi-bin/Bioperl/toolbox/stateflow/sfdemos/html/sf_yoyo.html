%% Yo-Yo Control of Satellites
%
% This demo is a model of a tethered satellite system, which consists of a
% small satellite attached by a long tether to an orbiting platform.  The
% control system within this model is used to stabilize the pendulum to
% prevent it from exhibiting too much libration (oscillation).  This is done
% by reeling out the tether to its maximum length when the satellite is in
% the middle of its arc (which decreases its angular acceleration) and by
% reeling in the tether when the satellite's angular velocity is equal to
% zero.
% 
% Stateflow(R) is used to control when the tether is reeled in or reeled out
% using input events from Simulink(R).  When the satellite is in the middle of
% its swing (theta = 0), the state ReelOut is entered.  When the satellite
% has been reeled out as far as it can, the state ReelStop is entered.  When
% the angular velocity of the satellite reaches zero, the ReelIn state is
% entered.  And when the tether is as short as possible, the ReelStop state
% is once again entered.  Finally, if the total energy of the satellite is
% too low, the system is inactivated by entering the Inactive state.
