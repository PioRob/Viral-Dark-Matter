Stateflow&reg; enhances the Simulink model with its representation of the transmission control logic. Simulink provides a powerful environment for the modeling and simulation of dynamic systems and processes. In many systems, though, supervisory functions like changing modes or invoking new gain schedules must respond to events that may occur and conditions that develop over time. As a result, the environment requires a language capable of managing these multiple modes and developing conditions. In the following example, Stateflow demonstrates its strength in this capacity by performing the function of gear selection in an automatic transmission.

%
% The input-output characteristics of the torque converter can be expressed as

%
% The shift logic behavior can be observed during simulation by enabling
% animation in the Stateflow debugger. The |selection_state| (always active)
% begins by performing the computations indicated in its |during| function. The
% model computes the upshift and downshift speed thresholds as a function of the
% instantaneous values of gear and throttle. While in steady_state, the model
% compares these values to the present vehicle speed to determine if a shift is
% required. If so, it enters one of the confirm states (|upshifting| or
% |downshifting|), which records the time of entry.
%
% If the vehicle speed no longer satisfies the shift condition, while in the
% confirm state, the model ignores the shift and it transitions back to
% |steady_state|. This prevents extraneous shifts due to noise conditions. If the
% shift condition remains valid for a duration of |TWAIT| ticks, the model
% transitions through the lower junction and, depending on the current gear, it
% broadcasts one of the shift events. Subsequently, the model again activates
% |steady_state| after a transition through one of the central junctions. The
% shift event, which is broadcast to the |gear_selection| state, activates a
% transition to the appropriate new gear.
%
% For example, if the vehicle is moving along in second gear with 25% throttle,
% the state |second| is active within |gear_state|, and |steady_state| is active in
% the |selection_state|. The |during| function of the latter, finds that an upshift
% should take place when the vehicle exceeds 30 mph. At the moment this becomes
% true, the model enters the |upshifting| state. While in this state, if the
% vehicle speed remains above 30 mph for |TWAIT| ticks, the model satisfies the 
% transition condition leading down
% to the lower right junction. This also satisfies the condition [|gear == 2|] on
% the transition leading from here to |steady_state|, so the model now takes the
% overall transition from |upshifting| to |steady_state| and broadcasts the
% event |UP| as a transition action. Consequently, the transition from
% second to third is taken in |gear_state| which completes the shift logic.

% The first column corresponds to time; the second column corresponds to
% throttle opening in percent. In this case no brake is applied (brake torque is
% zero). The vehicle speed starts at zero and the engine at 1000 RPM. Figure 12
% shows the plot for the baseline results, using the default parameters. As the
% driver steps to 60% throttle at |t=0|, the engine immediately responds by
% more than doubling its speed. This brings about a low speed ratio across the
% torque converter and, hence, a large torque ratio (see Figure 6 and Figure
% 11. The vehicle accelerates quickly (no tire slip is modeled) and both the
% engine and the vehicle gain speed until about |t = 2 sec|, at which time a 1-2
% upshift occurs. The engine speed characteristically drops abruptly, then
% resumes its acceleration. The 2-3 and 3-4 upshifts take place at about four
% and eight seconds, respectively. Notice that the vehicle speed remains much
% smoother due to its large inertia.

% *Figure 12:* Passing maneuver simulation time history
%
% At |t=15sec|, the driver steps the throttle to 100% as might be typical of
% a passing maneuver. The transmission downshifts to third gear and the engine
% jumps from about 2600 RPM to about 3700 RPM. The engine torque thus increases
% somewhat, as well as the mechanical advantage of the transmission. With
% continued heavy throttle, the vehicle accelerates to about 100 mph and then
% shifts into overdrive at about |t = 21 sec|. The vehicle cruises along in
% fourth gear for the remainder of the simulation. Double click on the ManeuversGUI
% block and use the graphical interface to vary the throttle and brake
% history.

%% Conclusions 
%
% One can easily enhance this basic system in a modular manner, for example, by
% replacing the engine or transmission with a more complex model. We can thus
% build up large systems within this structure via step-wise refinement. The
% seamless integration of Stateflow control logic with Simulink signal
% processing enables the construction of a model which is both efficient and
% visually intuitive.
