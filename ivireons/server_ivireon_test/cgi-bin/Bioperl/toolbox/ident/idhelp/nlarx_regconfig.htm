<title>Help: Configuring Regressors for Nonlinear ARX Model</title>

<body>

<center><h3>Configuring regressors for Nonlinear ARX Model</h3></center>

<p>Model Regressors dialog shows the list of regressors
currently available for the selected output of the Nonlinear ARX model. This
dialog is launched by pressing the Edit Regressor... button in the Nonlinear
Model window's Regressors (tabbed) panel (available for Nonlinear ARX models
only). This dialog facilitates the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
 <li>It allows selection of a subset of regressors to use in
     the nonlinear block of the Nonlinear ARX model. Note that all regressors
     are used by the linear block.</li>
 <li>It allows creation/import of custom regressors to be added
     to the list of regressors. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Regressors are transformations of input and output
channels that are used as inputs to the linear and nonlinear blocks. Regressors
are created in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By entering orders (delay and number of terms) in the Regressors table 
    (in the Nonlinear Model window). These are called <i>standard</i> regressors.</li>
<li>By creating regressors in the Custom Regressors dialog that is opened by pressing 
    the Create... button in the Model Regressors dialog. These are called 
    <i>custom</i> regressors. Custom regressors may also be imported from MATLAB workspace 
    by pressing the Import... button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Model Regressors dialog shows the standard and the custom
regressors under two collapsible panels titled Standard Regressors and Custom
Regressors respectively. Each panel contains a table listing the names of
regressors in the first column and offering a checkbox in the second column to
include or exclude a regressor. The Custom Regressors panel also contains three
buttons for creating, importing and deleting custom regressors. Standard
regressors cannot be deleted; to modify the list of standard regressors, use
the regressor order table in the Nonlinear Model window.</p><hr>

<center><h3><a name="select_regressor">Selecting a Subset of Regressors for 
Nonlinear Block</a></h3></center>

<p>The popup menu at the very top of the Model Regressors
dialog offers seven different ways of selecting the subset of regressors to use
in the nonlinear block. These options are listed below. For all except the
automatic selection (search) option, the choices made are also shown in the two
tables.</p>

<ol>
 <li>All: All regressors listed in the two tables
     (standard + custom) will be used (default).</li>
 <li>Standard regressors containing input variables only: The
     subset of standard regressors that are derived from input variables only
     will be used. This amounts to removing auto-regressive components as well
     as influence of other outputs in the model for the current output. None of
     the custom regressors are included.</li>
 <li>Standard regressors containing output variables only: The
     subset of standard regressors that are derived from output variables only
     will be used. This amounts to removing direct effect of inputs in the
     model for the current output. None of the custom regressors are included.</li>
 <li>Standard regressors only: All the standard regressors, as
     listed in Standard Regressors table, are used, but none of the custom
     regressors are used.</li>
 <li>Custom Regressors only: All the custom regressors, as
     listed in Custom Regressors table, are used, but none of the standard
     regressors are used.</li>
 <li>Automatically select (search) during estimation: This
     option causes the best subset of regressors to be determined automatically
     during estimation. This option is quite useful if there is not much prior
     information on which regressors to use. When this option is selected, the
     checkboxes in the two regressor tables are hidden, since their status
     (checked or unchecked) is determined during estimation. Note that
     depending upon the total number of regressors listed in the two tables and
     the number of model I/Os, this option can slow down the estimation
     significantly. Search for bet subset of regressors can easily take several
     minutes.</li>
 <li>Manually select: Select the regressors manually by
     checking or un-checking the checkboxes in the two tables explicitly. Any
     time a checkbox is clicked in either of these two tables, this popup
     option is automatically selected.</li>
</ol>

<center><h3>Modifying Custom Regressors</h3></center>

<p>The Custom Regressors panel in the Regressors Dialog contains options for 
modifying custom regressors. In addition to choosing a subset of regressors 
to use (as described above), a user may:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Press Create... button to launch <a
     href="nlarx_customreg.htm">the Custom Regressors dialog</a> which offers
     two ways of creating new regressors.</li>
 <li>Press Import ... button to import regressors from MATLAB
     Workspace or from a MAT file.</li>
 <li>Press Delete button to delete selected custom regressors.
     To delete regressors, select the corresponding row(s) in the Custom
     Regressors table and then press the Delete button.</li>
</ul>
