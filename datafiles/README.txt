EDT2238-41.xlsx

	A file containing three replicates each of clones EDT2238, EDT2239, EDT2240 and EDT2241. The data is organized first by well (growth condition), then by clone (each clone has three replicates an average for the three replicates and standard deviation).

	Is the same thing as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns.

EDT2231_5948.xlsx

	A file containing three replicates of each clone VCID5946, VCID5947, VCID5948 and EDT2231. The data is organized the same as the first file.

EDT2231_5948_noavg.xlsx

	Is the same as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns.

EDT2231_5945_5949_5957_5959avg.xlsx

	A file containing three replicates of each clone EDT2231, VCID5945, VCID5949, VCID5957 and VCID5959.

EDT2231_5945_5949_5957_5959noavg.xlsx

	Is the same as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns.

2231_5988-6012avg.xlsx

	A file containing three replicates of each clone EDT2231, VCID5998, VCID6010, VCID6011 and VCID6012.

2231_5988-6012noavg.xlsx

	Is the same as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns.

2231_6reps_avg.xlsx

	A file containing six replicates of EDT2231 (A-C are from file EDT2231_5945_5949_5957_5959avg.xlsx and D-F are from file 2231_5988-6012avg.xlsx).

2231_6reps_noavg.xlsx

	Is the same as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns

2231G-H_avg.xlsx

	A file containing three replicates of EDT2231 (using new plates and film).

2231G-H_noavg.xlsx

	Is the same as above, except without the average and standard deviation columns

miniX 76437 Matt Haynes_Forest Rohwer_Savannah Sanchez_SDSU_yeast_Sept 2011_submit.xlsx

	Is the metabolomic data for PhoH, VCID5604, VCID5605, VCID5606, VCID5609 and VCID5610. There are two sheets: Raw data and normalized data (I used normalized for my analyses).

	UCDavis' explanation of how they normalized:

	"Since we were not quite sure about the study design, we here give you both sets, the 'raw data' set with metabolite intensities as reported by the BinBase database, and the 'normalized data set' where we normalized all data to the sum of all identified metabolites in each sample (to correct for errors in sample prep and data acquisition)."

miniX 77035 Matt Haynes_Forest Rohwer_Savannah Sanchez_SDSU_E.coli_Oct 2011_submit.xlsx

	Is the metabolomic data for EDT2243, EDT2231, EDT2237, EDT2236, EDT2235 and EDT2238.

minix 77923 sanches haynes october 2011_submit.xls

	Is the metabolomic data for EDT2253, EDT2254, EDT2242, EDT2252, EDT2241, EDT2240 and EDT2239.

metabolomics_analysis_v2.xlsx

	Is the preliminary analysis for each of the following clones compared to EDT2231 (negative control): PhoH, EDT2235, EDT2236, EDT2237, EDT2238, EDT2239, EDT2240, EDT2241, EDT2242, old phoH (phoH data from June 2010 collected by Matt) and EDT2243. Each clone has two sheets. The first is the statistics for the comparison of compound abundances where I list the compound name, mean for EDT2231, mean for the particular clone being compared to EDT2231, the standard deviations for each mean, fold difference between means and the p-value (T-test). The second sheet is a list of ranked subsystems (each with ranked lists of their "important" functional roles) that have at least one significant compound associated with them (significant compounds are those that have an abundance difference with a p-value < 0.05). The first column is the subsystem's name, the second column corresponds to the specific functional roles identified, column D tells how many significant compounds are associated with each, then the particular significant compounds are listed horizontally followed by their change in abundance (-1 corresponds to the abundance being LOWER in EDT2231 and 1 corresponds to the abundance being HIGHER in EDT2231).

chemical_compound_rosetta.txt

	Is a file of all the named compounds found in the metabolomics files (for now excluding the latest data file). The first column corresponds to each compounds SEED compound identifier, the second column corresponds to the KEGG identifier while the third is the UCDavis ID (which is in the fourth row of each metabolomics file) and the fourth row corresponds to all variations of each compounds name found in the SEED.
