%% Sequence Recognition Using Mealy and Moore Charts
% 
% This demo shows how Mealy and Moore machines can be used in signal
% processing applications; in this case, for sequence recognition.  In the
% Moore machine, actions can only be state actions, whereas in the Mealy
% machine, actions can only be condition actions.
% 
% The two Stateflow(R) charts are used to find the sequence 1,2,1,3 in the
% input signal from Signal Builder.  The status of the sequence recognition
% is logged in the output variable "state."  If the sequence is found, the
% variable seqFound is set to 1.  On running the simulation and opening the
% scopes, notice that the Moore output is delayed by one time step.  This
% is because the output from a Moore machine is based on the state from the
% previous time step, and the output from a Mealy machine is based on the
% state from the previous time step and the current input.
