function [cnt,pct] = getTotalOverflows(ntx)
% Add up the bins that are beyond the integer threshold setting.
% This indicates the number of data values that will not be representable
% in the word size, if this number of integer bits is chosen.
% This implies these values will overflow the data type.

%     (ie, those negative values that have large magnitude)
%     no need to do anything more for those -- just be careful not to
%     double-count these values
