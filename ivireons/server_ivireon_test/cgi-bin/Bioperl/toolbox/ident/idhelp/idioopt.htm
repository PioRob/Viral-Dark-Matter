Enter the optional variables in the edit boxes.
Default values are obtained by leaving the space empty, or entering the word 'Default'.
 Press Apply to accept the variables as entered.
<dl>
<dt><b>Search Method</b>
<dd>The search method used by the
iterative search algorithm. Assignable values:
<ul>
 <li>Choose automatically (<tt>auto</tt>) - An automatic choice of a
     search method (default) from among <tt>gn</tt>, <tt>lm</tt>, <tt>gna</tt> 
     and <tt>grad</tt> line search schemes. </li>
 <li>Gauss-Newton (<tt>gn</tt>): Gauss Newton direction based line
     search scheme</li>
 <li>Adaptive Gauss-Newton method (<tt>gna</tt>) - Gauss-Newton direction with
     an adaptive cut-off of singular values</li>
 <li>Levenberg-Marquardt method (<tt>lm</tt>) – Traditional Levenberg-Marquardt
     direction based linear search</li>
 <li>Trust Region Reflective Newton (<tt>lsqnonlin</tt>) - Nonlinear
     least-squares method, provided by Optimization
     Toolbox.
     </li>
 <li>Gradient Search (<tt>grad</tt>) – steepest descent direction based
     line search.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Note: 'lsqnonlin' requires Optimization Toolbox&#8482;. It minimizes <tt>Trace</tt> criterion only (see below).  
<BR><BR>
<dt><b>Minimization Criterion</b>
<dd>Minimization criterion for iterative search. Assignable values:
<ul>
 <li> <tt>Determinant</tt> (default) - <tt>det(E'*E)</tt> is minimized (with some 
      normalization), where E is the prediction error matrix. This leads to maximum 
      likelihood estimate of parameter values under the assumption of residuals being Gaussian.</li>
 <li> <tt>Trace</tt> - Weighted least squares: <tt>trace(E'*E*W)</tt> is minimized 
      (with some normalization), where E is the matrix of prediction errors over the 
      available time span. Weighting <tt>W</tt> is specified through the "Weighting" 
      Algorithm property (see below).</li>
</ul>

<dd> The two criteria are equivalent for single-output models. This setting provides a way of
controlling relative weighting of outputs in a multi-output model.
<BR><BR>
    
<dt><b>Weighting</b>
<dd> Weighting <tt>W</tt> applied to trace minimization. When 
  minimization criterion = <tt>Trace</tt>, <tt>trace(E'*E*W)</tt> is minimized. Weighting 
  should be specified as a positive semi-definite matrix. It can be used to specify 
  relative importance of outputs in multi-output models (or reliability of 
  corresponding data). For such a use, specify a diagonal matrix for Weighting. 
  Weighting is not useful in single-output models. By default, <tt>W</tt> is an identity matrix 
  of size equal to number of model outputs (implying all outputs are to be given equal   
  importance during estimation). Note that weighting does not apply to determinant 
  minimization criterion.
<BR><BR>
    
<dt><b>FixedParameter</b>
    <dd>A row vector containing the indices or names of the parameters to be kept fixed
    during the minimization. Default is no fixed parameters.
    The indices are discussed in the manual section Enumeration of Estimated Parameters.
    See also IDPROPS ALGORITHM.<br>
Examples: <tt>[5,8,12]</tt>  or <tt>{'A(1,2)','K(2,3)'}</tt>
<BR>
Note the curly brackets for string parameter names.
</dl><p>
The next three options are all described under Algorithm Properties in the documentation.
<dl>
<dt><b>MaxIter</b>
    <dd>The maximum number of iterations to be performed. Default value 20.
<dt><b>Tolerance</b>
    <dd>When the expected improvement in the criterion is less than <tt>Tolerance</tt> 
    (measured in percent) the iterations are terminated. Default value 0.01.  
<dt><b>LimitError</b>
    <dd>Robustification of the quadratic criterion of fit. Residuals that are larger than
    <tt>LimitError</tt> times the estimated standard deviation carry a linear rather than
    quadratic weight. <tt>LimitError = 0</tt> disables the robustification and gives a pure
    quadratic criterion. Default value 0.
