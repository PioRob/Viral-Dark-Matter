This folder contains a number of files to allow Parallel Computing Toolbox
to be used with SGE via the generic scheduler interface.

Note that all the files in this directory will work only for clusters that are 
running on UNIX.

RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER SHARE A FILE SYSTEM 
========================================================

If the client machine is able to submit directly to the cluster
and there is a shared file system present between the client and
the cluster machines, use the files in the "shared" folder.

If the client machine is not able to submit directly to the cluster
(for example if the scheduler's client utilities are not installed) 
and there is a shared file system present between the client and
the cluster machines, use the files in the "remoteSubmission" folder.


RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER DO NOT SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
===============================================================

To run jobs in the absence of a shared file system between client and 
cluster machines, use the files in the "nonshared" folder.
