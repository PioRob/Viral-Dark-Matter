%% Variable Lighting
% 
% vrlights is an example with light sources. In the scene there are Sun (modeled as
% DirectionalLight) and Lamp (modeled as PointLight) moved around from the Simulink(R)
% model, creating the illusion of changes between day and night terrain illumination. In the
% associated VRML file, several viewpoints are defined that allow you to observe gradual
% changes in light from various perspectives.
% 
% While the effect of moving light sources on the terrain is directly visible, the VRML world
% background doesn't automatically reflect the current light sources status. Background
% color needs to be specifically changed depending on the Sun position. Here it is done
% using a VRMLScript. For details please view the associated VRML file vrlights.wrl in a text
% editor.
% 
% This example can be used for training user navigation and testing the use of navigation
% zones in various navigation modes.
