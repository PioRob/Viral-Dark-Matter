function [U,T] = rsf2csf(U,T)
%RSF2CSF Real block diagonal form to complex diagonal form.
%   [U,T] = RSF2CSF(U,T) transforms the outputs of SCHUR(X) (where X
%   is real) from Real Schur Form to Complex Schur Form.  The Real
%   Schur Form has the real eigenvalues on the diagonal and the
%   complex eigenvalues in 2-by-2 blocks on the diagonal.  The Complex
%   Schur Form is upper triangular with the eigenvalues of X on the
%   diagonal.
%   
%   Arguments U and T represent the unitary and Schur forms of a 
%   matrix A, such that A = U*T*U' and U'*U = eye(size(A)).
%
%   Class support for inputs U,T:
%      float: double, single
