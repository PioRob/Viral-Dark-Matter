In general, it is simpler and faster to model a system at complex baseband. However, there are some circumstances where it is preferable to model the system at real passband. An example of this is when an adjacent band tonal signal is processed with a nonlinearity, and causes interference in the band of interest. This demo illustrates this scenario by assuming a 16-QAM communications system transmitting in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with interference in its passband. A tone in an adjacent channel that has been processed by a cubic nonlinearity causes this interference.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Initialization</a></li><li><a href="#3">Baseband Modulation</a></li><li><a href="#6">Frequency Upconversion</a></li><li><a href="#7">Channel Simulation</a></li><li><a href="#9">Frequency Downconversion</a></li><li><a href="#10">Baseband Demodulation</a></li><li><a href="#16">Summary</a></li><li><a href="#17">Selected Bibliography</a></li></ul></div><h2>Initialization<a name="1"></a></h2><p>First, initialize variables that define simulation parameters, such as carrier frequency, number of samples representing a symbol, and noise level.</p><pre class="codeinput">Fc = 2.5e6;         <span class="comment">% Carrier frequency (Hz)</span>

%% Passband Modulation with Adjacent Channel Interference
% This demonstration shows how to use baseband modulators and demodulators with
% frequency upconversion and downconversion to simulate passband communication
% systems. In general, it is simpler and faster to model a system at complex
% baseband. However, there are some circumstances where it is preferable to
% model the system at real passband. An example of this is when an adjacent band
% tonal signal is processed with a nonlinearity, and causes interference in the
% band of interest. This demo illustrates this scenario by assuming a 16-QAM
% communications system transmitting in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
% channel with interference in its passband. A tone in an adjacent channel that
% has been processed by a cubic nonlinearity causes this interference.

%% Initialization
% First, initialize variables that define simulation parameters, such as carrier
% frequency, number of samples representing a symbol, and noise level.

Fc = 2.5e6;         % Carrier frequency (Hz)
Rsym = 1e6;         % Symbol rate (symbols/second)
nSamps = 8;         % Number of samples per symbol
frameLength = 2048; % Number of symbols in a frame
M = 16;             % Modulation order (16-QAM)
EbNo = 15;          % Ratio of baseband bit energy to noise power spectral density (dB)

% Calculate sampling frequency in Hz
Fs = Rsym * nSamps;

% Calculate passband SNR in dB. The noise variance of the baseband signal is
% double that of the corresponding bandpass signal [1]. Increase the SNR value
% by 10*log10(2) dB to account for this difference and have equivalent baseband
% and passband performance. 
SNR = EbNo + 10*log10(log2(M)/nSamps) + 10*log10(2);

%% 
% *Initialize Measurement Tools*
%
% Initialize a scatter plot and a spectrum estimator to analyze signals at
% different points in the transmitter-receiver chain.

% Create a Welch spectrum estimator.
specScope = spectrum.welch('Hamming',512);

% Create a spectrum estimator options object to configure the spectrum
% estimator.
specOpts=psdopts(specScope);

% Create a scatter plot scope for received symbols.
scatScope = commscope.ScatterPlot('SamplingFrequency', Rsym, ...

%% Baseband Modulation
% The first step of simulating a passband communication system is to modulate
% the random data in the baseband.  You generate random symbols, modulate them
% with a 16-QAM modulator, and apply pulse shaping using a square root raised
% cosine filter.

%%
% *16-QAM Modulation*

% Create a 16-QAM modulator.
hMod = modem.qammod('M',M);

% Set the expected constellation of the scatter plot scope.
scatScope.Constellation = hMod.Constellation;
scatScope.PlotSettings.Constellation = 'on';
scatScope.PlotSettings.ConstellationStyle = '*r';

% Generate random data symbols.
b = randi([0 hMod.M-1], frameLength, 1);

% Modulate the random data.
txSym = modulate(hMod, b);

%%
% *Pulse Shaping*
%
% After modulation, you apply pulse shaping using a square root raised cosine
% filter.  You use the spectrum estimator to verify that the frequency spectrum
% of the baseband signal is centered at zero Hz, and that it has been filtered
% properly.

% Specify a square root raised cosine filter with a filter length of eight
% symbols and a rolloff factor of 0.2.
nSym = 8;       % Length of the filter in symbols
beta = 0.2;     % Rolloff factor
filterSpec = fdesign.pulseshaping(nSamps, 'Square root raised cosine', ...
  'Nsym,Beta', nSym, beta);

% Design the transmitter filter.
hXmtFlt = design(filterSpec);

% Apply pulse shaping by upsampling and filtering.  Alternatively, you can use
% an efficient multirate filter if you have a Filter Design Toolbox(TM) license.
% See help for fdesign.interpolator for more information.
x = filter(hXmtFlt, upsample(txSym, nSamps));

% Estimate spectrum of pulse shaped signal.
psdProbe = psd(specScope, x, specOpts);
hFig = figure;plot(psdProbe)

%% Frequency Upconversion
% You apply frequency upconversion to obtain a passband signal around the
% specified carrier frequency.  You achieve this by multiplying the complex
% baseband signal with a complex sinusoidal and taking the real part.

% Generate carrier. The sqrt(2) factor ensures that the power of the frequency
% upconverted signal is equal to the power of its baseband counterpart.
t = (0:1/Fs:(frameLength/Rsym)-1/Fs).';
carrier = sqrt(2)*exp(1i*2*pi*Fc*t);

% Frequency upconvert to passband.
xUp = real(x.*carrier);

% Estimate spectrum.
psdProbe = psd(specScope, xUp, specOpts);
plot(psdProbe)

%% Channel Simulation
% Simulate the communications channel as a passband real AWGN channel with an
% adjacent channel interference caused by a tone processed with a cubic
% nonlinearity.
    
% Create the passband interference by raising an adjacent channel tone to the
% third power.

% that contains points with +/- 1 and +/- 3 amplitude levels, the average power

%% Frequency Downconversion
% You apply frequency downconversion to obtain a baseband signal before
% demodulation.  You achieve this by multiplying the complex passband signal
% with a complex sinusoidal.  The following code assumes perfect phase
% synchronization, so it uses the same carrier signal as the transmitter.

%% Baseband Demodulation
% Once the signal is in baseband, you can apply matched filtering.  Note that
% the matched filter also removes the unwanted higher frequency components due
% to frequency downconversion.  

%%
% *Matched Filtering*

% Make a copy of the transmitter filter and use it as matched filter.
hRcvFlt = copy(hXmtFlt);

% Filter the frequency downconverted signal.

% Amplify the signal to compensate for the power loss caused by pulse shaping
% and matched filtering. This places the received signal symbols around the
% expected 16-QAM constellation points.

%%
% *Demodulate*
%
% After matched filtering, you downsample and demodulate the 16-QAM signal to
% obtain the data symbols. 

% Downsample the filtered signal.  Discard the first nSym symbols due to filter
% delay.
e2eDelay = nSamps*nSym;

% Demodulate received symbols and count the number of symbol errors.
xHatACI = demodulate(hDemod, rcvSymDownACI);
numErr = sum(xHatACI~=b(1:end-nSym))

%%
% Repeat the steps above to obtain received symbols without adjacent channel
% interference. The symbol error rate (SER) results of the interference-free
% passband 16-QAM system should match the theoretical SER for a 16-QAM baseband
% system in an AGWN channel.

y = yUp.*conj(carrier);

%% 
% *Symbol Error Rate Curves*
%
% To obtain SER curves for the 16-QAM communications system with and without
% adjacent channel interference in the passband, you can format the steps of
% this demo into a for-loop to run simulations for several transmitted frames.
% In such simulations, you need to carry the state of the system components,

%
% Using the simulation function, simulations for Eb/No in the [0, 12] dB
% interval were performed for 2e3 transmissions of frames of length 5e3 symbols.
% The commdoc_passband_mod_results.mat file contains the results of the

% simulations. You can compare the results of 16-QAM passband modulation with
% and without adjacent channel interference and the theoretical curve of 16-QAM
% modulation in a baseband AWGN channel by loading the aforementioned file.

%% Summary
% This demo illustrated how to use a baseband modulation object together with
% frequency upconversion and downconversion to simulate a passband communication
% system with a cubic nonlinearity acting on an adjacent channel. Even though it
% is usually simple and faster to simulate a system at complex baseband, there
% are some circumstances where it is preferable to model the system at real
% passband. The demo presented an example for the case when an adjacent band
% signal is processed with a nonlinearity, and causes interference in the band
% of interest.
