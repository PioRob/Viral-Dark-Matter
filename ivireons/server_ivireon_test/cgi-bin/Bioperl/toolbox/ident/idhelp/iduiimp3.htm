<title>Importing Frequency Domain Data</title>
<center><h3>Importing Frequency Domain Data</h3></center><p>

This dialog is used to import the input and output signals or frequency response signals. 
The imported data is added to the Data Board in the ident window.<p>
 
<b>Data Format for Signals</b> pop-up menu options:<br>
    <dl>
    <dt><b> Frequency Domain Signals</b>
    <dd> Use when input and output signals are given in the frequency domain (Fourier transforms)
    
    <dt><b>Frequency Function (Complex)</b>
    <dd> Use when the frequency response of a model y = G u + H e
    is given as the complex-valued frequency function G(exp(iwT)), w is a vector
    of frequencies, and T is the sampling interval. For continuous-time models the 
    frequency function is G(iw).
    
    <dt><b>Frequency Function (Amp/Phase)</b>
    <dd>
    Same as above, except that G(iw) is given as 
    Amplitude = abs(G(iw)), and the Phase = arg(G(iw)) in degrees (not complex values).
    </dl><p>
    
    
<b>Workspace Variable</b><br>
Enter valid MATLAB expressions in the <b>Input</b>, <b>Output</b>, and <b>Frequency</b> fields.  The 
expressions must evaluate to either a column vector or a matrix.  The frequency vector
must have the same number of rows as the input and output signals. For example,<p>

<tt>   [temp(234:500) current(234:500)]</tt><br>
where <tt>temp</tt> and <tt>current</tt> are column vector variables 
in the MATLAB workspace.<p>

For single-input/single-output data, all signals must be vectors. For
a data set with Ny outputs, Nu inputs, and Nf frequencies, the frequency function data are
Ny-by-Nu-by-Nf arrays (applies to frequency function, amplitude, and phase). For input-output data, the signals
are Nu-by-Nf and Ny-by-Nf matrices, respectively.<p>

<b>Data Information</b><br>
<b>Data name</b> (Optional) Enter any string. The data set 
is labeled with this name in the ident window.<br>
<b>Frequency unit</b> Enter <tt>Hz</tt> or <tt>rad/s</tt>, 
depending on the unit you specified for the frequency vector.
  In the GUI, the default frequency unit is rad/s. However, you
can enter different frequency units in plot views.<br>
<b>Sampling interval</b> is essential for frequency domain data to 
specify the Nyquist frequency, as well as to correctly interpret the model. 
For continuous-time data, enter 0 (zero).<p>

Click the <b>More</b> button to expand the dialog and specify the properties that 
associate the data with, <br>
<b>Channel Names</b> designate the individual channels in the input and output data. Enter the names without quotes and separated by commas. 
Default names for input channels are <tt>u1</tt>, <tt>u2</tt>,... (the maximum number of channels is specified by input dimensions).
Similarly, the output channels are named as <tt>y1</tt>, <tt>y2</tt>, .... The noise
sources are automatically named for the corresponding output:
<tt>e@yname</tt> is the name of the disturbance that is additive to the
output with channel name <tt>yname</tt>.<br>
The number of names must equal the number of channels.<p>

<b>Physical Units of Variables</b> <br>
(Optional) Enter the units for the measured variables. These are used
only for plot information.<br>
Enter units as comma separated strings without quotes.<p>

<b>Notes</b> <br>
Enter any text that describes the data and the models.  The notes remain 
associated with the data and any models that are estimated from it.<p>

To hide the expanded pane, click <b>Less</b>. <p>
Click <b>Import</b> to import the data set. The data icon is added to the
 Data Board in the ident window.<p>
 
To restore all default values in this dialog, click <b>Reset</b>.<p>

<b>Note:</b> To import a variable from the MATLAB workspace in the
IDDATA format, select <b>Import data->Data object</b> from the pop-up menu to open the Import Data Object dialog. 
Or, type the hotkey <b>d</b> when the ident window is in focus.
