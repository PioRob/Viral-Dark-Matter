%% Fixed-Point Filters
% 
% Sample bit-true implementations of fixed-point direct type I and II filters with time-varying and
% time-invariant coefficients are presented.  These filters use the fundamental capabilities in
% Simulink(R) Fixed Point(TM) and work with the autoscaling tools in Simulink Fixed Point.
% 
% Note: the Filter Design Toolbox(TM) and Signal Processing Blockset(TM) leverage this capability and 
% extend it by providing high level design tools and multirate implementations for complex 
% real-time signal processing applications.
