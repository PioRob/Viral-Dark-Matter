function this = delevent(ts,event,varargin)
%DELEVENT  Remove event objects from a time series object.
%
%   TS = DELEVENT(TS, EVENT), where EVENT is an event name string, removes the
%   corresponding tsdata.event object from TS.EVENTS property. 
%
%   TS = DELEVENT(TS, EVENTS), where EVENTS is a cell array of event name
%   strings, removes tsdata.event objects from the TS.EVENTS property.
%
%   TS = DELEVENT(TS, EVENT, N) removes the Nth tsdata.event object, whose
%   name is EVENT, from the TS.EVENTS property.
%
%   Example
%
%   Create a time series:
%   ts=timeseries(rand(5,4))
%
%   Create an event object called 'test' where the event occurs at time 3:
%   e=tsdata.event('test',3)
%
%   Add the event object to time series TS:
%   ts = addevent(ts,e)
%
%   Remove the event object from time series TS:
%   ts = delevent(ts,'test')
