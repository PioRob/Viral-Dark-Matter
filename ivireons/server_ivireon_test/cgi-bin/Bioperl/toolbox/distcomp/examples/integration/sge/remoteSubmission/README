This folder contains a number of files to allow Parallel Computing Toolbox
to be used with SGE via the generic scheduler interface.

The files in this folder assume that the client and cluster share a file system 
and that the client is not able to submit directly to the cluster using the
qsub command.

Note that all the files in this directory will work only for clusters that are 
running on UNIX.

Instructions for Use
=====================
Running Parallel Jobs
---------------------
For running parallel jobs, an SGE parallel environment is required. The "matlab"
parallel environment is based on the "MPI" example shipped with SGE. To use this
parallel environment, the "matlabpe.template" must be used.  This template must
be customised to match the number of slots available, and to match where the
"startmatlabpe.sh" and "stopmatlabpe.sh" scripts are installed on your cluster.

The following stages are needed to create the parallel environment, and then
make the parallel environment runnable on a particular queue.  You should perform 
these steps on the headnode of your cluster.

1. Modify the contents of matlabpe.template to use your desired number of slots and
the correct location of the startmatlabpe.sh and stopmatlabpe.sh files.  You can also
change other values or add additional values to matlabpe.template to suit your cluster.  
For more information, refer to the sge_pe documentation provided with your scheduler.

2. Add the "matlab" parallel environment, using a shell command like:
       
       $ qconf -Ap matlabpe.template

3. Make the "matlab" PE runnable on all queues:

       $ qconf -mq all.q

This will bring up a text editor for you to make changes: search for the line
"pe_list", and add "matlab"

4. Ensure you can submit a trivial job to the PE:

       $ echo "hostname" | qsub -pe matlab 1

Check that the job runs correctly using "qstat", and check that the output file 
contains the name of the host that ran the job.  The default filename for the 
output file is "~/STDIN.o###", where "###" is the SGE job number.
   
On the Client Host
------------------
1. The files in
$MATLABROOT/toolbox/distcomp/examples/integration/sge/remoteSubmission
must be present on the MATLAB path. Copy them to $MATLABROOT/toolbox/local or modify
the MATLAB path from within MATLAB.


2. Read the documentation for using the generic scheduler interface with
the Parallel Computing Toolbox and familiarize yourself with the different 
properties that can be set for a generic scheduler.

In the MATLAB Client
--------------------
1. Create a generic scheduler object for your cluster.  For distributed jobs, 
you must use distributedSubmitFcn as your submit function.  For parallel jobs, you must 
use parallelSubmitFcn as your submit function.  
Both of these functions require one additional string value input:
    a. clusterHost - The name of the cluster host that will call the qsub command.

Example:
sched = findResource('scheduler', 'type', 'generic');
set(sched, 'ClusterMatlabRoot', '/apps/matlab');
set(sched, 'ClusterOsType', 'unix');
% Use a folder that both the client and cluster can access
% as the DataLocation.  If your cluster and client use 
% different operating systems, you should specify DataLocation 
% to be a structure.  Refer to the documentation on 
% genericscheduler for more information.
set(sched, 'DataLocation', '/home/DATA_LOCATION');
set(sched, 'HasSharedFilesystem', true);
% Define the cluster host that will be used for job submission
clusterHost = 'myHost1';
% The SubmitFcn must be a MATLAB cell array that includes the additional input
set(sched, 'SubmitFcn', {@distributedSubmitFcn, clusterHost});
% If you want to run parallel jobs (including matlabpool), you must specify a ParallelSubmitFcn
set(sched, 'ParallelSubmitFcn', {@parallelSubmitFcn, clusterHost});
set(sched, 'GetJobStateFcn', @getJobStateFcn);
set(sched, 'DestroyJobFcn', @destroyJobFcn);


2. Create a job and some tasks, submit the job, and wait for it to finish before
getting the results. Do the same for parallel jobs if so desired.  

Note that the first time you submit a job to the scheduler from any client MATLAB session 
you will be prompted to provide your username and other credential information for the 
cluster host that will submit the job.  If you choose to use an identity file, this must 
be an ssh identity file.

If you need to change your credentials, you can reset them using the following command 
in the MATLAB command window:
    sched.UserData.RemoteConnection.disconnect

You will be prompted to provide your credentials again when you next submit a job.

As an alternative to these steps, create a parallel configuration that defines the 
appropriate properties and run configuration validation to verify that the configuration
works correctly.


Description of Files
====================
For more detail about these files, please refer to the help and comments contained in the 
files themselves.

MATLAB Functions Required for genericscheduler 
----------------------------------------------
distributedSubmitFcn.m
    Submit function for distributed jobs.  Use this as the SubmitFcn for your genericscheduler object.
parallelSubmitFcn.m
    Submit function for parallel jobs.  Use this as the ParallelSubmitFcn for your genericscheduler object.
destroyJobFcn.m 
    Destroy a job on the scheduler.  Use this as the DestroyJobFcn for your genericscheduler object.
getJobStateFcn.m
    Get the job state from the scheduler.  Use this as the GetJobStateFcn for your genericscheduler object.

Other MATLAB Functions
-----------------------
extractJobId.m
    Get the scheduler's job ID from the submission output.
getSubmitString.m
    Get the submission string for the scheduler.
createSubmitScript.m
    Create a script that is executed on the cluster host to perform job submission.
getRemoteConnection.m
    Get or create a parallel.cluster.RemoteClusterAccess connection.  If a new connection
    is created, this function prompts for user credentials either through standard 
    MATLAB dialogs or the command line and stores the connection in the UserData property of
    the scheduler object.  If you provide the incorrect credentials, you can reset the 
    credentials using the following code:
        >> sched.UserData.RemoteConnection.disconnect();
    
    Refer to the MATLAB help for parallel.cluster.RemoteClusterAccess for more information.  

Executable Scripts
-------------------
distributedJobWrapper.sh
    Script used by the scheduler to launch the MATLAB worker processes for distributed jobs.
parallelJobWrapper.sh
    Script used by the scheduler to launch the MATLAB worker processes for parallel jobs.


Optional Customizations
========================
The code customizations listed in this section are clearly marked in the relevant files.

distributedSubmitFcn.m
----------------------
distributedSubmitFcn provides the ability to supply additional submit arguments to the 
qsub command.  You may wish to modify the additionalSubmitArgs variable to include additional
submit arguments that are appropriate to your cluster.  For more information, refer to the 
qsub documentation provided with your scheduler.
 
parallelSubmitFcn.m
--------------------
parallelSubmitFcn calculates the number of nodes to request from the scheduler from the 
MaximumNumberOfWorkers property of the parallel job.  You may wish to customize the number of
nodes requested to suit your cluster's requirements.

parallelSubmitFcn provides the ability to supply additional submit arguments to the 
qsub command.  You may wish to modify the additionalSubmitArgs variable to include additional
submit arguments that are appropriate to your cluster.  For more information, refer to the 
qsub documentation provided with your scheduler.

parallelJobWrapper.sh
---------------------
parallelJobWrapper.sh uses the StrictHostKeyChecking=no and UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null options
for ssh.  You may wish to customize the ssh options to suit your cluster's requirements.  For 
more information, refer to your operating system the ssh documentation.

getRemoteConnection.m
---------------------
getRemoteConnection.m uses either standard MATLAB dialogs or command line input to request 
credentials from users.  You may wish to provide default credentials or modify the manner 
in which the credential information is requested.
